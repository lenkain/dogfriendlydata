COMMENTS: The 1800 Sea Captain's estate is now the only Bed & Breakfast Inn in Hyannis Port in the center of Cape Cod. 14 rooms in two buildings. Anything but formal, the Inn is just a great place to call your home while on the Cape. Full breakfasts, wine hour(s), free bikes, beach stuff, billiards and a bunch more. People friendly as well as dog-friendly. You'll feel a zillion miles away, yet be a half mile from anything, town, beaches, ferries and such. It's really a wonderful place to hang out at and venture out from. We feel it is, and so do all the major guidebooks, and most of the folks who have stayed here and come back. Just a chance to see the collection of over 50 classic red sports cars behind the Inn at Toad Hall is probably worth the trip by itself.

COMMENTS: The Inn at Lake Joseph provides its guests with comfort, serenity, and all the amenities and ambiance of a memorable Catskills New York getaway. Guests enjoy exquisite views of the Catskills from the Inn's private 250 acre lake and have endless opportunities to get outside and explore the area.<br><br>This bed and breakfast offers privacy and relaxation with its 16 guestrooms and rustic accommodations, some of which are pet-friendly. Dogs of all sizes are welcome and invited to roam the beautiful lawns and forests surrounding the Inn. Four-legged guests receive blankets in their rooms, but human guests must bring appropriate food and supplies. The charge for dogs is $25 per night. Book online or call 845-791-9506!
OLDCOMMENTS: The Inn, located high in the Catskill Mountains on a 250-acre private lake two hours from the NY Metropolitan Area, hosted its first guests in 1984. Like resort hotel lodging, this Country Inn provides a variety of summer and winter recreation activities, including swimming, fishing, boating, kayaking, hiking, tennis, bicycling, cross-country skiing, tobogganing, sledding, snow shoeing and the use of a nearby full-service health and fitness club. But unlike larger hotels, the Inn, with only 17 guestrooms, has been described as a non-pretentious, romantic, luxury, jeansandsneakers, casual country retreat that assures guests a relaxing, private, rustic, mountain lake environment. Breakfast is served on the screened veranda, surrounding guests with the sounds and feel of the lush green forest. When glassed in during winter, guests experience the beauty of a surrounding snowscape. Over the years, the Inn has received numerous awards and has been praised in travel articles and publications, as well as by guests themselves on Trip Advisor. The Inn consists of three distinct dwellings: The Lodge with its casual English Country environment; and for more rustic accommodations, the Adirondack-style Cottage and Carriage House guestrooms with their own private entrances, where pets are welcome. In addition, all of the guestrooms have working fireplaces and whirlpool baths; and most have private sundecks.

BOOKCOMMENTS: Bandon Sea Breeze is a family home vacation rental that welcomes children, pets, and large groups. The house is a few steps from the beach. There is a fenced yard for your dog.
COMMENTS: We bought a vacation home so we would have somewhere to take our dogs on vacation!  Then we decided to open our home to other families who consider their dogs "part of the family."  Bandon Sea Breeze is a large, comfortable family home located on Bandon's jetty that welcomes children, pets and large groups.  The jetty beach is a public beach that's seconds on foot from The Sea Breeze's front door.  Dogs are permitted on the beach as long as they are under control.<br><br>The home features spacious bedrooms, a full kitchen, stone ireplace, cable TV, outdoor hot tub, covered patio with grill and perhaps of most interest to dog owners, a fenced yard.  The bedrooms are split into two separate but connected wings, making the home ideal for groups or family reunions. The 6-person hot tub is secluded in the backyard .<br><br>Bandon's jetty is a spit of land between The Coquille River and The Pacific Ocean.  It's a truly unique setting that surrounds the home in the signts, sounds and smells of the sea.  The upstairs room has a view, but that's hardly the point.  When you are at Bandon's Sea Breeze, you ARE the view!

BOOKCOMMENTS: This country inn allows dogs provided they have had a health certificate from a vet within the last 10 days. There is a $40 per night pet fee and pets are not allowed in the main lodge. 
COMMENTS: Pamper your fido friend and yourself in the luxury of a AAA 4 Diamond Country Inn.  The Allagash suite in the Carriage House has been set aside you and your loving campanion. This luxury suite with stunning lake and mountain views along with private outdoor deck, double Jacuzzi, fireplace and living room area, results in the ideal retreat.  Pet Policy:  The Lodge understands how wonderful it is to share a Moosehead vacation with your canine campanion.  Pet lovers ourselves and proud owners of 3 Labrador Retrievers, we realize that, especially in unfamiliar settings, dogs will be dogs; despite an historical track record of exemplary behavior.  With respect to other lodging guests, pets are not allowed in the Main Lodge.  We therefore happily allow you to share with your pet the creature comforts of your guest room, provided they adhere to the following conditions:  Pooch's must have health certificate from veterinarian no more that 10 days prior to arrival and must be washed and on flea medication as well.  All pets incur a $40.00/night charge.  They will receive a dog matt, bowls for food and water along with nightly treats.  No pets on the beds or furniture.  When outside of their guest room on the Lodge property, pets must be on a leash and owners must clean up after them.  When left in their room alone, your pet must be created (the Lodge provides creats at $10.00/night charge).  We reserve the right to refuse daily housekeeping or turndown service to rooms in which a pet is left loose in the room.  In addition to the nightly charge, a $200 pet security deposit is required upon arrival.  This deposit is refundable at the time of departure barring any unintentional property damage, "accidents", noise complaints, or disobedience of our leash law.  Should your pet seriously damage an item of lodge property, you will be charged full replacement value.  Chronic disturbance issues may result in requiring you to take your pet to a local kennel.

Many animals, when left alone in a strange place, react in ways their parents could never have imagined.  If at any point you must leave your pet alone, please ASK the front desk if this is ok, and leave contact information should we need to contact you with  any issues.  (If it is after we are closed, please do not leave the pet unattended).<br><br>Please be considerate of other guests staying with us, and remember not all people are comfortable with animals. Keep your pet on a leash when outside your unit, and please pick-up their "business" (bags are available upon request if you do not have any of your own).<br><br>St. Augustine is a very Pet Friendly town.  Pets are welcome to join in the fun on the beaches, at the parks, throughout the old city and at many restaurants where dining outdoors is available.

COMMENTS: Nestled on 4 acres of Cape Cod's unspoiled historic district, guests at the Lamb and Lion enjoy lots of privacy with spacious suites, all with private baths, and separate guest entrances and exits (no curfews, and no tip-toeing around someone's living room!). The Inn is located about 1 mile from beautiful Barnstable Harbor (and the whale watch boat!) and just a few short minutes from all the best beaches, shopping and restaurants that Cape Cod has to offer. Here you have the very best of both worlds...the peaceful setting of "Olde Cape Cod", yet you're less than 10 minutes from the nightlife and shops of colorful Main Street, Hyannis!<br><br>The diversity of accommodations is one of the many perks that the Lamb and Lion has to offer...Ultra-clean suites with wood-burning fireplaces, cozy rooms with gas fireplace stoves, and some with full kitchens. Some suites can accommodate a family or a small group of friends. All of the rooms are just a few steps away from the central courtyard which features a heated pool and giant year-round hot tub spa, and all the rooms feature top-of-the-line bedding, private in-room baths, cable TV, wireless internet, A/C, sitting areas and telephones!<br><br>All room rates include our very unique Gourmet Continental Breakfast which can feature anything from Ali's "famous" granola (once featured in Bon Appetit Magazine), slow-roasted fruit, "Monkey Bread", and "Gooey Caramel-Orange Ring". Breakfast is served in the same laid back fashion as the Inn is run. You can have your breakfast any time you like, and you can enjoy it anywhere you like--in the Breakfast Sunroom, on the decks overlooking the "Elvis Willow Tree" and gardens, poolside...or back in your suite! After you fill up on breakfast take a short walk to our local beach, hike a trail in the beautiful conservation land right across from the Inn, or just veg-out poolside with a good book!<br><br>The Inn accepts smaller pets at a charge of $25 per day, with a $100 maximum. For larger pets there may be flexibility in the slower seasons. Please inquire.

COMMENTS: OUR GUEST REVIEWS SAY IT ALL:<br>"Broad Creek Quest Quarters is a quiet and laid back resort with plenty of things to do. For instance, there's tennis, a gym, restaurant, huge marina, pool, whirlpool, sauna, hiking, etc. I thought there would be a problem with my dog because he is a 75 pound retriever who loves to swim. On the property is a boat ramp to launch boats, so I suppose if you have a boat you can bring it with you, but there is a pier and ramp where my dog could actually get in and out of the water on his own. This is one of the best vacations I have ever been on, because my dog, who I love very much had a great time, and felt at home. Our caretakers Peg and Harold are very hospitable and will help you with any of your requests, and they are a lovely couple. I would highly recommend Broad Creek for pet owners with concerns about where to stay with there four legged friends."<br><br>"Aside from the beautiful decorations, cleanliness of the rooms, tasty breakfast, helpful proprieters, and natural beauty that is new Bern, we love staying at Broad Creek because we can bring our large dog with us for a nominal pet fee. For people that own pets and that travel you know how important it is to have your animal with you in a safe and comfortable environment! Coady loves it! He can lounge around on the nice cool tiles in the summer or "hang out" on one of the fabulously decorated porches in the winter!"<br><br>All 'pet friendly' GUEST QUARTERS have private screened porches for superior squirrel, bird, & people watching.<br><br>Rates include- INDOOR and OUTDOOR POOLS, Gym, TENNIS, Game Room, BBQ/picnic areas, & PARK/LAUNCH for your boat.<br>Complimentary WIFI, continental breakfast, & daily housekeeping.<br><br>Waterfront restaurant & grocery/market/cafe are a short walk.<br><br>2 pet maximum(dogs/cats only); $25/nt per pet.

You'll be greeted with a warm welcome and special dog treats, and just wait until you see all the wonderful outdoor experiences awaiting you: stroll in the shade and splash in our spring-fed stream as the bluebirds swoop by, wander along mowed paths through our wildflower meadows, or play a game of Frisbee in the field kept mowed just for you. Don't worry if you get a little dirty -- there is a special outdoor dog washing station equipped with shampoo (just let us know if you need towels).

BOOKCOMMENTS: Dogs are allowed in this vacation rental near Santa Barbara. There is a security deposit for pets.
COMMENTS: Step through the gates of Spring House and you will be welcomed by a serene fountain and Zen statuary. Enjoy secluded privacy in a lush tropical setting. Step outside the gates and you are a mere 5 minute walk from Butterfly Beach - the most beautiful beach in Santa Barbara, the historic Four Seasons Biltmore Hotel and Spa, and Coast Village Road - the exclusive heart of Montecito with a wide variety of dining options, boutiques and gift shops, and business and banking services. Enjoy that vacation cocktail without the worry of driving home! The unique layout of Spring House with two kitchens allows maximum flexibility for multiple families or families traveling with a nanny. The yard is fully enclosed and you may let your dog roam outside in complete confidence. The house contains 4bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, a Jacuzzi and sauna, 4 fountains, outdoor eating areas, gas BBQ, blow-dryers, iron and ironing board, toiletries, paper goods, all linens, bicycles, a beach wagon, sand toys, boogie boards, telephone, 4 flat-screens, 3 fireplaces, a computer, wireless internet, iPod docking stations, movies, books, games, and puzzles. Spring House exceeds customary expectations, and is a luxury experience from original art to thread count to Viking appliances.&#8232;Dogs must be clean, thoroughly brushed, and well mannered (that means house-broken!), neutered or spayed, on a flea control program, weigh no more than 30 pounds, and be a non-shedding breed. Please leave your big, shedding dogs at home. We have a lovely yard but it is not big enough to exercise a large dog, and the local beach does not allow dogs. Of course, if you bring a smaller dog you will find a list of dog friendly beaches at the house. Do not leave your dog alone in the house or yard. Lonely and bored dogs bark, dig and scratch on the doors. If we get a complaint about barking from one of our neighbors, your deposit will go to the neighbor. We will be happy to provide you with the names of reputable dog sitters, and will gladly make those arrangements for you if you prefer. Please be candid with us about your pet and we will try to work with you. You will find a pooper-scooper and duty bags on the premises, as well as Nature's Miracle and plenty of cleaning rags. Guests with dogs can expect all area rugs to be rolled up and stashed in a closet. In some of the bedrooms, quilts or duvet covers will be replaced with less costly and more durable bed furnishings. And please, do not let the dogs up on the furniture. $500 to $650/night with a 5 night minimum. $300 Cleaning Fee. $500 Security Deposit. 10% Occupancy Tax.

COMMENTS: These days, dogs are more than just pets for many people - they are bona-"fido" members of the family! That's why, for the first time in our 40+ years in business, we began our new dog-friendly rental program on a trial basis in 2010. Based on its rousing success, we're happy to say that it's back for 2011 (and with more participating properties!) As you might expect, there are some rules that must be followed and a small pet fee that will apply; you can see the complete list below.<br><br>So, if a day without your dog leaves you dragging your tail, just check the "dog friendly" box when searching for your next vacation property or view our Myrtle Beach area pet friendly rentals. Hot-diggety-dog!<br><br>Dunes Realty Pet Policies<br><br>A select number of our homes welcome dogs and are advertised as "Dog Friendly."  However, for your own comfort and for the comfort and safety of our homeowners and other guests, there are certain restrictions that must apply.<br><br>Dog friendly properties accept dogs weighing under 35 pounds and at least one (1) year old, with a maximum of two (2) dogs per property.  "Visiting" pets are not allowed.<br>A $200 non-refundable "Fido Fee" ($300 for two dogs) will apply to each reservation that includes a dog.<br>This fee includes the additional services necessary to ensure the comfort of our guests, and will even cover housetraining "accidents" provided they are reported to us as soon as possible.<br>This fee does not cover damage to the property or grounds resulting from a dog, including but not limited to chewing, scratching, digging and unreported housetraining accidents.<br>Guests will be required to sign a waiver indicating that they understand and assume responsibility for any such damage, and a credit card must be kept on file to cover any such expenses.  Damage attributed to a dog is not covered under our regular Damage Waiver.<br>Failure to follow these regulations will result in eviction without refund, as will the presence of a dog in any home not designated as Dog Friendly.<br><br>All local laws and regulations must be followed, and may vary depending on the location of your property. A partial list of those regulations most pertinent to our properties is as follows:<br>All pets must be leashed at all times in all jurisdictions.<br>Pet waste must be collected and properly disposed in all jurisdictions.<br>In Surfside Beach, dogs are not permitted on the public beach during the period between May 15 and September 15.<br>In Garden City Beach (Horry County,) dogs are not allowed on the beach between the hours of 8:00AM to 5:00 PM from May 15 to September 15.<br>In Garden City Beach (Georgetown County,) leashed dogs are permitted on the beach at all times.

In 1996, six more rooms were built to accommodate the tremendous influx of visitors to the motel. The Mountain Motel has been a family endeavor, being locally owned and operated since 1947 - over 55 years!<br><br>In December 2011, the new owner of The Mountain Motel felt that it was time to showcase the charm and history of the motel by performing a slight upgrade to the rooms as well as the Mountain Motel's brand. After transforming the office area into a lounge and reading room, the energetic owner set to work to begin outfitting the remaining nine rooms with an exhaustive inventory of Mountain Western Retro furniture, fixtures and room decor. The vision to make the Mountain Motel, Salida's FIRST "boutique motel" and reinventing an American icon - the roadside motel!<br><br>Foremost in the minds of the staff at the Mountain Motel is to provide guests with a comfortable, cozy, distinctive and memorable stay. One-size DOES NOT fit all! Each room has been re-imagined in a unique fashion, which brings the owner's distinct style to a historic Salida motel.<br><br>Room decor is an eclectic collection of "Mountain Western Retro" - reminiscent of properties dating back to the 1950's, and early 1960's.<br><br>We consider the Mountain Motel a forever evolving work of "motel art", where updates and decor are an on-going effort. We especially pride ourselves on being the only Salida, CO motel to bring the "boutique motel" experience to guests visiting the Arkansas River Valley.<br><br>The staff at the Mountain Motel invite you to share our "Mountain Western Retro" experience! Whether it be sharing stories in the lounge on a cold day with other guests, or sipping the special "Mountain Motel" iced-tea on a hot day. Without question, your stay at the Mountain Motel in Salida, Colorado will be a memory to share forever and keep you coming back, year after year.

They hassle guests who bring pets and make staying difficult with extra rules. Gabriel's is a breath of fresh air for dog owners - they are pet embracing. Our dog had a great time and so did we. The dog bed, bowls, and biscuits were a real treat for all of us. Thank-you so much for helping us to have a relaxing and memorable vacation."<br><br>"Until one has loved an animal, part of their soul remains unawakened."

COMMENTS: SAN FRANCISCO'S BEST KEPT SECRET **DOG HEAVEN** The "Historic" Marina Motel celebrates 75 years of European Charm with individually decorated rooms surrounding a flower filled cobblestone courtyard. Our Dog Friendly Rooms have fully equipped kitchens attached. FREE PARKING for one vehicle per room in individual garages under the rooms and a few outdoor spaces for larger vehicles (sorry no campers or U-Haul Trucks)<br><br> Put on Your Walking Shoes: Walk six blocks to a leash free beach where you can walk the sands to the Golden Gate Bridge. You can stop along the way at the Warming Hut for a latte or quick bit to eat as you watch the ships slip under the Golden Gate Bridge or the kite surfers catch some air. Along the way walk through the pet friendly gardens of Lucas Films (three blocks away) or follow the path that encircles the lake at the Palace of Fine Arts(four blocks away)to feed the swans. If you love to see the lives of the rich and famous, get ready to climb some of those hills that San Francisco is famous for and head straight from the Marina Motel up Broderick Street into Pacific Heights. Here you can stroll past the manicured front gardens of many castle-like mansions and enjoy their amazing views of the entire bay. When you get to the top, turn right and walk down the Lyon Street steps along side the Presidio and its extensive park lands and hiking trails. Keep an eye open for coyotes if you enter the Presidio in the early morning or around dusk.<br><br>Feel like a local as you sit in one of the many dog friendly sidewalk cafes and restaurants just around the corner on Chestnut, Fillmore and Union Streets. Besides having a few name brand stores like Pottery Barn, William Sonoma and the the Gap, Chestnut Street also has an array of boutiques, several jewelry stores, ice cream and candy stores, a high end pet store, two movie theaters, Marina Super with fresh produce displayed outside and a few nail salons for those in need of a manicure. Chestnut Street is also where our guests catch the #30 Bus which for $2 will drop you off at Fisheman's Wharf (7 min), Chinatown (15 min), Union Square (20 min) and AT&T ball park (30 min). This bus runs every 10-15 min and runs all night.<br><br>Pet policy: $15/night for the first dog, $10/night for second dog. NO SIZE RESTRICTIONS. Two dog max per room.  Besides the courtyard, we have a very cute dog run that is lit up at night for last minute pit stops before bed. We also have numerous doggie bag dispensers around the property and we kindly ask you to pick up after your dog on our property and elsewhere in the city, on the beach and on the trails. Sorry but due to barking issues, we no longer allow dogs to be left alone in our rooms unless they are crated.  Some guests leave their dogs in their cars with their windows partially down parked under the rooms for short periods of time during cool weather and we would be more than happy to check on your dog if this is the case.  Just let us know.

COMMENTS: Escape to the beautiful Northern California Sierra foothills to enjoy nature from the comforts of a luxurious hilltop guest house with spectacular sunset views. It's the best of both worlds with the peaceful privacy of 60 rural acres plus the conveniences of being only a few miles from the Gold Country towns of Pine Grove, Jackson and Sutter Creek. The ranch is just 2-3 hours from the Bay Area so it's an easy getaway for many Californians.<BR><BR>What makes the Dog & Pony Ranch so special are the features that have been designed for 4-footed family members who are not just 'pets considered' but PETS WELCOME! The house has tile and stained concrete floors and leather furniture that are dog-fur resistant as well as beautiful.  Outside the doggie door there are fetching/agility lawns, a large swimming pond and miles of trails for dogs to run off-leash on the private fenced 60-acre property. Yes, people can enjoy the hiking and swimming too, but we think it's so much better with man's best friend by your side. <BR><BR>The dog-friendly features extend to our farm-stay experience as well. Our barn animals currently include horses, llamas, cattle and chickens who are safely separated with fencing so typically come running to meet guests and their dogs, since it often means extra treats for them! See our website for some of the many photos of dogs going nose-to-nose with our friendly horses and curious llamas. It's hard to say which of our guests enjoy the chickens more -- people eating their farm-fresh eggs or dogs watching the hens run around just a few feet away.<BR><BR>Ranch life doesn't have to be rustic for human guests as you'll see in our 5-star guest house with spectacular sunset views, hot tub, and luxury amenities. We host only one group at a time with up to 6 people, so you have as much privacy as you want in this relaxing rural paradise. Plenty of entertainment options are available including a big screen TV with satellite and Netflix, WiFi internet, a large game room with foosball, ping pong, darts, plus horseshoes, cornhole and a basketball court outside. Covered patios provide a perfect place to hot tub and watch the sun set over neighboring vineyards.<BR><BR>Dog-loving guests rave about our unique property and have nicknamed it 'Doggie Disneyland'. All well-behaved dogs are welcome (any size/number/breed) at $0 additional charge (unless damages).
