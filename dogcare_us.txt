COMMENTS: Welcome to Playful Paws doggie daycare! We decided to open Playful Paws because we too have a dog, who we think of as our child and a part of the family. Baxter is a Puggle who loves people, but most of all loves other dogs. He is always on the lookout for new playmates and we hope your four-legged kids will join us. In building and planning Playful Paws we have used Baxter as our benchmark. Would we feel comfortable sending him here? Would he have fun and make friends? Is there enough for him to do? We made sure all the answers would be a resounding yes.<br><br>As dog parents ourselves we wanted to create an environment where dogs can play and socialize with each other in a fun and safe environment. To that end we have two separate play areas designed to accommodate the size temperament and activity level of every dog. In the summer months we have swimming pools for our water loving pals and year-round we have set up custom made play areas including different agility activities. This is in addition to of course rope toys, balls, Frisbees and a host of other games for all to play. We understand however that you cannot play all day long and for this reason we have setup a special room complete with couches, chairs, beds, a movie theater with special dog shows and of course an electric fireplace were rest and relaxation can take place between romps!<br><br>We believe a clean and sanitary environment is crucial to the comfort, safety and health of our all of our guests. For this reason every night all floors are cleaned and sanitized using special high-grade commercial floor scrubbers which kills any potential germs. We also require that all playmates are up to date on all vaccinations including Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvo, Bordetella, and Rabies. We keep careful records and send out an e-mail reminder to every parent 30 days prior to the expiration of any vaccine. We also offer Frontline and Advantix applications in-house, which can be scheduled ahead of time on a monthly basis. Our outside play area consists of special antimicrobial K9 grass. By taking all of these precautions we can keep kennel cough outbreaks often seen at other places to practically nonexistent.
