TYPE: National Park
COMMENTS: The Grand Canyon, located in the northwest corner of Arizona, is considered to be one of the most impressive natural splendors in the world. It is 277 miles long, 18 miles wide, and at its deepest point, is 6000 vertical feet (more than 1 mile) from rim to river. The Grand Canyon has several entrance areas, but the most popular is the South Rim. Dogs are not allowed in most areas of the North Rim of the Park. On the North Rim, the only trail that dogs are allowed on is the bridle trail from the lodge to the North Kaibab Trail (but not on the North Kaibab Trail). Dogs are not allowed on any trails below the rim, but leashed dogs are allowed on the paved rim trail. This dog-friendly trail is about 2.7 miles each way and offers excellent views of the Grand Canyon. Remember that the elevation at the rim is 7,000 feet, so you or your pup may need to rest more often than usual. Also, the weather can be very hot during the summer and can be snowing during the winter, so plan accordingly. And be sure you or your pup do not get too close to the edge! Feel like taking a tour? Well-behaved dogs are allowed on the Geology Walk. This is a one hour park ranger guided tour and consists of a leisurely walk along a 3/4 mile paved rim trail. They discuss how the Grand Canyon was created and more. The tour departs at 11am daily (weather permitting) from the Yavapai Observation Station. Pets are allowed in the Grand Canyon's Mather Campground in Grand Canyon Village (reservations 877-444-6777), the Desert View Campground 26 miles east of the village (no reservations), and, for RVs,  the Trailer Village in Grand Canyon Village. Trailer Village has full hookups and sites for trailers up to 50 feet. It is less than one mile from the rim and the village. Their advanced reservation number is 888-297-2757 and you can call 928-638-2631 for same day reservations. Dogs must be leashed at all times in the campgrounds and may not be left unattended. There are kennels available at the South Rim. Its hours are 7:30 am to 5 pm. To make kennel reservations or for other kennel information call 928-638-0534. The Grand Canyon park entrance fee is currently $25.00 per private vehicle, payable upon entry to the park. Admission tickets are  for 7 days.
