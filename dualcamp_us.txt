TOPCOMMENTS: Want to take your dog down to the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon but, of course, this is not allowed by the National Park Service? Instead, just downriver from Grand Canyon National Park is the Havasupai Indian Reservation, which shares the Canyon with the National Park. The canyon and the campgrounds are accessible only by foot, pack animals and helicopter. Leashed dogs may accompany you on the trails into the canyon, to the watersfalls, the campground and the Colorado River. Please clean up after your dog throughout the reservation. It is suggested that you inquire ahead as there is only limited space at the campground and there is an eight mile hike down into the canyon to the campground. Dogs are also allowed on the helicopters. For more information see the detailed listings.
COMMENTS: Want to take your dog down to the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon but, of course, this is not allowed by the National Park Service? Instead, just downriver from Grand Canyon National Park is the Havasupai Indian Reservation, which shares the Canyon with the National Park. And here, your dog may enter the canyon with you. The strikingly beautiful, secluded canyon sits at the west end of the Grand Canyon and is accessible only by foot, horseback, or helicopter. The entrance fee is $35 per person, and everything is carry in/carry out, or pack animals can be hired. Only a limited number of persons may visit the Havasu Canyon at a time, so advance inquiry is suggested. There is a large parking lot about 64 miles from the turn-off onto Indian Road 18 where visitors may park at Hualapai Hilltop. This is a trailhead with no services. Here you may start the 8 mile hike to the Supai Village in the canyon where there is a small café, lodge, general store, museum, and a post office that is the only office to still receive mail via Pony Express. The trail is moderately difficult and starts off steep with switchbacks for about the first 1 1/2 miles with narrow canyon passages before it levels out. The name Havasupai means 'People-Of-The Blue-Green-Waters' and the Havasu Creek is a year round spring-fed stream that will astonish visitors with the 4 powerful main waterfalls and deeply colored turquoise pools that it supplies. You first pass Supai Falls as you are nearing the village; then Navajo Falls is about 1 1/2  miles past the village. Just before you reach the campground about 2 miles past the village is the very popular, spectacular double waterfall of the Havasu Falls with a great swimming hole. Then, about 2 miles past the campground is Mooney Falls with the highest drop of 200 feet, but also the most difficult to access. The hiking trails of the Reservation include the hike in from Hualapai Hilltop to the village, to the camp area, and from the campgrounds to the Colorado River which is about 8 miles from the camp area.  There is no hiking allowed in Cataract Canyon or off the main trails. Dogs of all sizes are allowed for no additional fees. Dogs must be under their owner's control, and leashed and cleaned up after at all times. Dogs may not be left unattended at any time, and dog owners accept full responsibility for their pet. Dogs are allowed to take the helicopter ride in for about $25 for a small to medium dog; it may be more for a large dog. Their website is www.airwesthelicopters.com. Dogs are not allowed at the lodge or in the village buildings. Campers must pack all supplies and refuge in and out of the canyon. The camp area is primitive but rich with lush vegetation and shade trees. Amenities include spring water (treat or purify first), composting toilets, picnic tables, and night security during tourist season. The fee for tent camping is $10 per person, and no additional pet fee is required. There are no electric or water hookups at the campgrounds.

COMMENTS: Sculpted by glaciers, this national park features 2.3 million spectacular acres, hundreds of miles of trails, and diverse ecosystems that support a large variety of native ecosystems and species unlike anywhere else in the world. It also offers a wealth of natural resources, recreational, and educational opportunities. One favored trail, Nature Trail 370 is located at the base of Big Mountain Ski Resort about 8 miles from Whitefish and features 4 different pathways that offer fields of wildflowers, sweeping vistas, and short, long, and elevation choices. Each of the 5 Ranger stations offers maps of the trails and they are also available on line. Dogs of all sizes are allowed for no additional fee. Dogs may not be left unattended at any time. Many of the wilderness areas, developed campgrounds, day use areas, and picnic sites require dogs to be on leash. They can be off leash in the National Forest if they are under good voice control; however leashing is suggested due to wild animals. Dogs must not chase game animals at any time. Although you can normally camp anywhere in National Forests following certain restrictions, there are 27 campgrounds here on a 1st come 1st served basis that may have some or all of the following: potable water, flush/vault/pit toilets, boat ramp access, and ADA accessibility. A list of campgrounds and of the 5 ranger districts that oversee them can be found at http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/flathead/rec/myweb/camp.pdf. This rv park is closed during the offseason. The camping and tent areas also allow dogs. There is a dog walk area at the campground. There are no electric or water hookups at the campgrounds.
