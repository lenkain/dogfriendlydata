COMMENTS: Pawsitivity Service Dogs trains autism assistance dogs for children, to help with socialization, education, and seizures. Children with autism have difficulty with social skills such as empathy, have trouble with language development, often exhibit repetitive behaviors, sometimes exhibiting seizures, as well. They may be teased or bullied, or simply ignored as a result of not understanding the unspoken rules of social interaction. Service dogs can help mitigate many of these problems, serving as a bridge to social interactions with both peers and adults, as well as help with motivational, behavioral, and sensory challenges. Pawsitivity is proud to train these amazing dogs, creating a human-canine bond that changes lives.

COMMENTS: Welcome to Best DAWG Rescue, Inc. We save shelter animals (primarily dogs) including those who require substantial medical care or who are overlooked because they are shy or older. We restore their health and nurture them until they are ready for adoption. Our purpose is to find them the right homes…this time forever. When Best Dawg Rescue accepts a dog (or other animal) into its care, the dog remains with us until a permanent home is found. No dog is ever returned to a shelter or to its previous situation.  If an adoption fails, we gladly take our precious animals back. We are committed to them for the rest of their lives.Best DAWG Rescue invites you to visit our animals on this website and by attending our adoption fairs. You may apply for one of our animals online. You may contact us by e-mail with questions you have about our animals. If you need assistance in selecting an appropriate pet, we will help you since we know our animals and what kind of home would be best for them.We can't save these deserving animals without YOUR help. Best DAWG Rescue is an all-volunteer organization with 501(c)(3) status. The majority of our donations is spent on the animals in our care; the remainder is spent on necessary administrative expenses (telephone, photocopying, etc.).In addition, DAWG seeks volunteers to help at weekly adoption shows, and is grateful for supporters' talents to help us grow and thrive.For additional information, contact us at dawg@dawg-rescue.org.

COMMENTS: The Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation, the only guide dog school located in New England, is a non-profit organization based in Bloomfield, Connecticut that breeds, raises and trains German shepherd guide dogs to be placed with blind men and women. The organization was founded in 1960 as the Fidelco Breeder's Foundation and donated dogs to several guide dog schools until 1981, when the current organization was expanded to include a training program. Fidelco is a pioneer in the guide dog field in the U.S. with its unique home-based training program, which makes it possible for a blind person to remain in his/her home environment while being trained with a Fidelco guide dog. Because of this program, Fidelco is able to customize its training to the particular lifestyle, needs and locale of the blind recipient.

COMMENTS: We Are a No-Kill Sanctuary. Currently our efforts are focused on dogs, who live safe and free here while they recover physical health and emotional harmony. All are spayed or neutered, receive appropriate veterinary care, and excellent nutrition. No cages, no chains. They have 35 snugly fenced acres on which to run and play. They are occasionally separated in large shady enclosures as may seem prudent for the safety and comfort of both the newcomers and the old-timers - an adjustment period that is usually brief, since most dogs are so fond of other dogs. As needed, they receive homeopathic and herbal remedies, nutritional supplements, chiropractic treatment, acupuncture, and western medicines to address acute or chronic physical or behavioral symptoms. When they are ready, we help them to join new human families. Occasionally an unexpected condition such as cancer is revealed during the initial veterinary exam. Or a traumatized animal who functions joyfully in this "free" environment cannot adjust to the requirements of life as a "pet" and is considered "unadoptable." We do everything possible to help those animals achieve comfort and happiness and they live out their lives with us.

COMMENTS: RUF is a 501(c) 3nonprofit organization in Arlington, Texas. The members were brought together by the mutual enjoyment of exercising with their dog companions offleash. The group was formed to give voice to the shared feelings that public park spaces are for the benefit of all citizens and for us that means space to play, walk, jog, and interact with our canine pals offleash.

Our first goal is the designation of areas within Arlington where responsible dog owners can legally take their dogs and enjoy themselves while exercising and socializing their dog.  You can help by joining or volunteering . 

We believe that responsible dog guardians need a place where they can legally take their dogs offleash. Currently people throughout Arlington are taking their dogs out and letting them run offleash in all of our parks and public areas. The current situation allows many undesirable behaviors and misconceptions of offleash dog areas to persist. 

We believe that with some special rules, well-defined boundaries, and a cooperative citizen group to help with education, enforcement, maintenance, fund raising and other necessary tasks offleash areas can be made available without much initial public expense. 

We believe that RUFF is the cooperative citizen group that can make dog parks happen and that can speak out on behalf of responsible pet guardians. 

We believe that an organization centered on meeting the needs of responsible pet guardians will decrease the number of surrendered dogs in Tarrant County and increase the number of adoptions. 

RUFF welcomes any interested person to join us in this effort. Just contact us and ask how to become involved. Also, if you have a good off (or on) leash story about you and your dog, or another dog, you can submit that to Webmaster@txruff.org and look for a spot on our story page!

COMMENTS: Jack Russell Terrier Rescue Ontario is a small volunteer organization that is dedicated to placing unwanted or abandoned Jack Russells. We arrange rescues throughout Ontario, and gathers information designed to match appropriate dogs in appropriate permanent and temporary homes. 

The majority of the dogs are unwanted simply for being Jack Russell's by nature and behavior. Owners often find that they were unprepared for the care required for this feisty terrier; and did not understand the nature of the breed, and their instinctive desire to hunt. Owners are often gone all day, and therefore unable to provide the time, and level of activity necessary for this active little dog. Sometimes jobs or life situations change, making it impossible for someone to keep their beloved pet.

COMMENTS: Animal Rescue Movement (ARM) was established in 1993. We are a non-profit, no-kill, all-volunteer organization in the Jacksonville and Northeast Florida area.Our mission is to seek the proper medical care for all animals rescued by us, to spay/neuter all animals BEFORE they are placed in their new homes, to love and socialize these animals to ensure the success of their future adoption, and to place them in permanent, loving homes.

We also strive to educate the public of the importance of spay/neuter and proper medical care, heartworm prevention, crate training when appropriate and socialization/training of their pet(s). 

ARM rescues abused, injured, unwanted and abandoned dogs and cats from local shelters and streets. For these animals, being rescued is the difference between life and death, as most of these loving pets would otherwise face certain death due to pet overpopulation and overcrowding in our local shelters. We rescue mixed breed as well as purebred animals. Once rescued, ARM provides food, proper medical care, spay/neuter and all necessary vaccinations.
Since ARM does not have a shelter, "foster parents" take these animals into their homes and continue the loving care. In these homes, the animals receive training, socialization and evaluation. Lifestyle and needs of prospective adopters and pets are carefully matched to ensure the best placement. Potential adopters are asked to complete an adoption application and interview with an ARM Adoption Counselor.

COMMENTS: Yorkies Inc. is a New England based agency specializing in re-homing, adoption and rescue of Yorkshire Terriers... We are private nonprofit organization dedicated to the well being of the Yorkshire Terrier. We are a very small group of Yorkie friends that have previously belonged to other national yorkie rescue groups. We felt there was a need to bring things down to scale and focus on the pups themselves. In October 2004 we joined efforts to form Yorkies Inc., a new type of organization dedicated to help Yorkies in need of re-homing for whatever the reason.  Because we are small we offer a dedication and bonding to the dogs that is often lacking in other national groups. We can also work very closely with the surrendering families to insure piece of mind to them, while also offering safe and caring foster homes knowledgeable of the breed. We take great pride in providing the very best veterinary care and finding the very best forever homes for the dogs entrusted to us. It is because of this passion for the breed that we are very selective on the homes in which we will place our Yorkies. All our pups are completely vetted and are spayed or neutered before placement.

COMMENTS: The Mid-Atlantic Great Dane Rescue League, Inc. (MAGDRL) was organized in 1979 to serve the seven states of the Mid-Atlantic region. The organization is a DC corporation and has a charitable tax-exemption under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

MAGDRL is staffed completely by volunteers. Like all humane groups, MAGDRL is in the unique position of helping both humans and pets. In our case, the pets are Great Danes and mixed Dane dogs, and the people are those who have or want the companionship of the breed or, often, just dogs in general.

MAGDRL helps people to:

Determine the right breed of dog for their lifestyle. 
Find healthy and companionable Danes that fit their circumstances. 
Find loving replacement homes for Danes they can no longer keep. 
Become knowledgeable about the care and training of their Great Danes. 
Resolve their Danes physical/behavioral problem. 
Overcome the grief at the loss of their loved pet. 
Stretch their tax dollar by assuming the Dane burden from public shelters. 
MAGDRL helps Danes:

By providing for the rescue and care of those who have been abandoned, neglected, and/or abused by their previous owners. 
We spay/neuter and provide medical treatment as necessary to return the Dane back to good health. 
We also supply training/socialization to ensure their adaptability to new, good homes. 
We work to place rescue Danes to people who provide secure, loving, and healthy homes.

COMMENTS: Jin-Sohl Jindo Dog Rescue is an organization dedicated to educating the public about Jindo dogs, to providing support and guidance to Jindo owners, and to rescuing Jindos from Southern California shelters when possible. 

The majority of dogs taken in by JJDR come to us through Los Angles City and County shelters. They were either picked up as strays running the streets of Southern California or were dumped at the shelter by uncaring owners. Unfortunately, the need for rescue far exceeds the space available, and it's only the lucky few who make it into foster care. 

When a dog is brought into rescue they are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, checked over by a veterinarian, and microchipped. They are then placed in an evaluators home where they are temperament tested and quarantined for a minimum of two weeks. After evaluation they are placed up for adoption and the search for that dogs perfect home begins. 

In addition to fostering and placing dogs, JJDR takes it's role as an educational organization very seriously. In addition to producing numberous flyers and brochurs, JJDR attends pet expos and other events throughout the year to help educate the public about Jindos. JJDR also provides support for current Jindos owners to help keep Jindos in the good homes they already have.

COMMENTS: The Humane Society of Williamson County (HSWC) is an "open-door" shelter serving the city of Round Rock and unincorporated areas of Williamson County. We are committed to accepting every stray, unwanted, injured or abused animal, in addition to young, healthy puppies and kittens. This means that animals that arrive at our shelter get a second chance at finding a new home if their owners do not reclaim them.

The HSWC mission: 


Prevention of cruelty to animals 
Extension of humane education 
Reduction of over-population of dogs and cats 
Reunion of lost animals with their owners 
Placement of ownerless animals in good homes 
Promotion of animal welfare through education, legislation, and sterilization 
The HSWC, like many open-door shelters, makes room for all animals in need, without condition and irrespective of age, health or temperament. HSWC never critiques incoming animals on their ability to be adopted; we make room for all animals in need. Among the animals that HSWC has placed with loving caring families are elderly animals, animals missing limbs, and blind animals.

Like all shelters, we have limited funds and space for the animals that come to our door. Both "no-kill" and open-door shelters must euthanize for health or temperament problems. Because we accept all animals who come to us, we must sometimes euthanize for space reasons.

Unlike most open-door shelters, the HSWC is a non-profit, 501 (c) 3, charity dependent upon the generosity of donors and contributors for its existence. Over 50% of our funding comes from donations. HSWC is willing and able to care for every animal brought to its door, but only with your help.

COMMENTS: The Humane Society of Monroe County (HSMC) was founded in 1954 by Monroe County residents who were concerned for the welfare of the companion animals in our community. For approximately 30 years, the society has operated a shelter where stray, abandoned or surrendered animals receive care – food, shelter, medical attention and love – until they can be placed in a permanent home. The society also promotes the humane treatment of animals through education; attempts to re-unite lost animals with their owners, and promote spaying or neutering of pets to control the population of unwanted animals.

The HSMC is a non-profit, no-kill organization governed by a volunteer board of directors. We employ a small but dedicated staff to care for the animals, operate the shelter and conduct our outreach programs and events. Currently, the society does not receive government funding. Our budget is comprised from fundraising events, memberships, donations, cage sponsors and shelter operations. A dedicated group of volunteers provides invaluable assistance in conducting our community outreach programs.

The Humane Society of Monroe County is not part of, nor do we receive any support from the Michigan Humane Society, American Humane Association or the Humane Society of the United States.

COMMENTS: Missing Pet Partnership is a national, nonprofit organization based in Fresno providing lost pet behavior and recovery training for animal shelters, humane societies, rescue groups and animal welfare organizations. According to the American Animal Hospital Association's 1995 Pet Owner's Survey, nearly 30% of pet owners in our nation have lost, and never again found, a missing pet. There is a science to finding lost pets, and it is based on a combination of law enforcement techniques used to find lost people and research into the behavior of lost pets. Through educational programs for staff and volunteers of animal welfare organizations, we can alleviate the suffering of lost pets and their owners. We can also have a significant effect on pet overpopulation by returning lost dogs and cats to their owner so they never become strays, and never end up in overcrowded shelters facing an uncertain fate. 
Additionally, Missing Pet Partnership trains and maintains a team of search and rescue dogs trained to locate lost pets and available to provide assistance on a case-by-case basis to residents of the Fresno area.

COMMENTS: New England Basset Hound Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded on June 20, 2001 by a group of basset hound lovers. Everyone involved with NEBHR is on a volunteer basis only and members reside throughout New England. We receive no financial compensation for our efforts. Like you, we all have jobs outside of the home, have families, and other important commitments. We do basset rescue because we want to help save homeless hounds and place them in good homes. 

New England Basset Hound Rescue, Inc. is always in need of foster homes throughout New England. We do not have a shelter that houses our rescue dogs; they live in our homes and are treated like a "member of our family". This gives us a great opportunity to evaluate the dog in a "home setting." 

After being evaluated, our hounds are spayed or neutered; given up to date vaccinations and the proper medical care until forever homes are found. All prospective adopters go through a full screening process before being deemed suitable basset hound owners.

We rely solely on donations to survive. Donations go towards shelter, food, vaccinations, spay, neuter and much needed veterinarian care for our basset hounds. We are pleased to say that NEBHR has found homes for over 400 abandoned/homeless basset hounds since June 2001!

COMMENTS: NIPRA, Inc. is a non-profit organization that exists to assist the community in placing any needy Pug dog in a permanent, loving home. All adoption fees and donations go solely for the rescue, care, and placement of mistreated, unwanted or homeless Pugs. 

NIPRA's mission is... 
To rescue, care for, and find suitable homes for unwanted, stray, or abandoned Pugs. To reduce pet overpopulation by increasing public awareness of the need to spay and neuter pets. To provide education programs promoting the humane treatment of animals. This mission is accomplished through the dedication and energy of our small shelter staff, board of directors, and legion of faithful volunteers.

NIPRA accepts stray and abandoned Pugs, which we care for until we find responsible new owners. Our ability to accept animals is limited to the space we have available. We euthanize animals only in cases of irremediable health problems or other grave circumstances.

COMMENTS: Our Companions is a nonprofit organization that believes no pet should ever be homeless. Every pet is a beautiful, blessed creature who deserves life and love. 

Yet, in Connecticut, healthy pets are destroyed every day. Some animals facing euthanasia have behavior problems that are easily corrected. Others have health issues that can be resolved in a caring home. Most just need the right treatment and a loving human companion.

The staff, animal experts, and volunteers at Our Companions believe there's a proper home for nearly every pet. We're working to create homes for the state's most abused, most neglected, most needy pets. Today we offer dog training classes, one-to-one pet consultations, community education, and many other services.

In the future, we'll offer Connecticut's first Pet Resource Center, which will include a domestic animal sanctuary on 43 acres of generously donated land. This project will provide a community destination having a spay/neuter clinic, low-cost dog training center, community center, pet assisted therapy programs, dog park, hiking trails and reflection gardens. At the sanctuary every animal will be saved from destruction and receive special care. Once healed, they'll become great candidates for adoption into loving, permanent homes.

We care so much about animals. You do, too. So, please find out more about us. Explore our website. Consider volunteering. Talk to your friends about us. Contribute funds. There are so many ways to help our neediest pets. 

Most importantly, I'd love for you to contact me at (860) 242-9999 or at SusanL@OurCompanions.org. Tell me your favorite pet story. I've got hundreds of my own. 

Gratefully,

Susan Linker

COMMENTS: The Second Chance Humane Society serves Ouray and San Miguel Counties, in southwestern Colorado. We have placed over 400 dogs and cats since our inception in 1994, and have played an integral role in uniting many lost animals with their families.  Our goal is to create a humane environment by:  sheltering animals in need, securing quality homes for animals, decreasing pet over population, promoting responsible pet ownership through education, and ultimately reducing the needless suffering of all domestic animals.  We are a private non-profit organization supported by membership dues, donations, grants, and fund raising events.  Currently, we fulfill our mission through the operation of a no-kill foster care program.  While in our foster program, abused animals learn to trust again, abandoned animals bond with humans again, whenever possible sick animals are healed, and adoptable animals are placed with new families.  Design of our permanent pet re-homing facility is ongoing and construction is planned to begin in 2005.

COMMENTS: Sometime around 5 years ago, a group of Doberman owners started meeting informally at local restaurants, talking about our favorite subject - the Doberman Pinscher.   We all had different interests in the breed - conformation, breeding, handling, obedience and agility training, tracking, rescue, pet therapy, health and genetics  and solely pet owner - but we were all drawn by our common love for this magnificent breed of dog.    We all felt there was a lack of a club in the area for the Total Doberman, as well as for those not necessarily interested in the showing aspects of the dog world, but wanting to communicate with and learn from others who love this breed.
  Our dinner meetings became more regular and we started discussing actually forming an official club.  We appointed officers and committee chairs, registered with the Secretary of State and the Department of Revenue and became officially "Cascade Doberman Pinscher Club".  Our logo committee worked long and hard to create a logo that best reflected our northwest club.  Who would have thought something as *simple* as a logo would take months and months of development??!!
As of March 2005, we are approximately three years young and are close to receiving AKC sanctioning.  We had a very successful obedience and agility fun match at Marymoor Park in May 2004.   It was successful both financially and as a public outreach for our club.   We received numerous compliments on the efficiency and organization of the match.   We had almost 100% participation of our membership which is unheard of in any type of club.  It really speaks of the dedication and commitment our club members have.  
We have also co-hosted two Working Aptitude Evaluations with the British Columbia Doberman Pinscher Club and held two successful  conformation fun matches.   We have made our presence known at Seattle Kennel Club the past two years, the Sirius About Dogs Funfest at Magnuson Park, and various other venues.  
Our commitment is to the betterment and positive image of the Doberman, as well as to offer ALL Doberman fanciers a place to feel welcome and included.  We have a strong dedication to rescue, as well as an obligation to educate people about whether or not the Doberman is the right breed for them and how to find an ethical breeder (Doberman Owner Buyer's Education - D.O.B.E.).
One positive aspect of this club and its members that I have noticed is that several members who previously had no interest in showing - in conformation or obedience or agility - are now getting involved and eagerly learning.  I think this shows how inclusive our club and its members are - it doesn't matter what your interest - we ALL support EVERYONE in what they do.   No one is left behind and I think the fact that our current President is a "...strictly pet owner..." proves that.
Remember, you don't have to own a Doberman to be a member of the club.  All it takes is a passion for the breed!

COMMENTS: German Shepherd Dog Rescue Group of GA (GSDRGA) was organized in 2004 to serve the needs of the Atlanta, GA Metro Area & beyond.  We have saved over 90 dogs since 3/04.  GSDRGA's mission is to find permanent new homes for German shepherd dogs that are in need of loving homes.   At the same time, we also find rescued German shepherd dogs for people who are in need of loving canine companions.  Some of the dogs we place have been given up by their owners; others came from animal shelters.  We screen all applicants and conduct a home visit before placing a dog.

GSDRGA is a 501 3c organization and a Georgia non-profit corporation funded entirely by donations.  We are a licensed GA rescue.

We are always in need of volunteers who love this noble breed. For addtional information on the group & upcoming events visit our website at www.gashepherd.org

COMMENTS: I am the organizer of The Centex Great Dane Meetup, a group of Great Dane lovers who get together once or twice a month to socialize, provide advice and training and most importantly, raise money to support Great Dane rescue. I am an American Kennel Club certified dog trainer, group organizer and rescue coordinator which keeps me very busy. Recently we've conducted our monthly Meetups at the Red Bud Isle dog park which has been absolutely perfect. We handed out plastic bags for people to clean up after their dogs, we gave away tennis balls and introduced ourselves to the community, it's been fantastic.  The American Kennel Club's National Responsible Dog Ownership day is coming up and the Canine Good Citizen training and test go hand in hand with the "holiday". As a certified AKC trainer I am qualified to conduct this prestigious test that promotes socially acceptable dogs. We have set up a training table to provide this beneficial community training in exchange for rescue donations! My group sells hand made dog treats, tennis balls and bottled water while I conduct several 30 minute training sessions to visiting dogs and owners. Most dog owners know about this test as many apartment complexes and pet friendly hotels require the certification before a dog can stay. We set up a discrete table, and offer our services without soliciting. We clean up after ourselves and our dogs and continue to offer the pooper scoop bags to park visitors. This is an awesome privilege and a wonderful opportunity not only for my group and rescue, but for the public park visitors as well! For more information you are welcome to check out the meetup group at http://greatdane.meetup.com/3, the AKC at www.akc.org, and/or Paws of Austin Great Dane Rescue at www.pawsofaustin.org.

As where the older dogs come out of the Shelter and are already spayed by the Shelter as where the puppies we have to pay our vets to get them Spayed and 
Neutered. We are Strictly NoN-Profit So none of the money Goes to the hard working Volenteers the work with all the dogs. If you have any Question fill free to email me @ dogsneedhelptoo@myway.com or call 1-702-591-6469.

COMMENTS: Eleventh Hour Rescue is made up of dedicated individuals who believe that innocent pets deserve love and a place to live where they are honored and cared for. No dog deserves to die simply because they do not have a home.  
We rescue dogs at the "eleventh hour"--when they are scheduled to be put to death by shelters who can no longer care for them. We give the dogs all the medical attention they require, a place to live, and through our adoption services, a second chance at a happy and fulfilled life. We are affiliated with many like-minded animal groups throughout the United States.  We invite caring people to join us as volunteers and graciously accept help in the form of time, supplies and monetary contributions. Eleventh Hour Rescue is a 100% volunteer organization funded exclusively by donations.

COMMENTS: Lions Foundation of Canada Dog Guides is a federally incorporated charitable foundation created by Lions clubs across Canada. Its mission is to provide service to physically challenged Canadians in the areas of mobility, safety and independence. 

Since 1983, Lions Foundation of Canada has operated Dog Guides Canada to provide specially trained Dog Guides to more than 1000 men, women and children ages eight to 84. The only Dog Guide school of its kind in Canada, Lions Foundation of Canada trains Dog Guides not only for the visually impaired but also for Canadians with hearing and other medically and physically limiting disabilities. 

All Dog Guides and required training, including transportation and accommodation, are offered at no charge to the clients. Lions Foundation of Canada operates two facilities in Ontario, including the head office and training facility in Oakville, and the breeding and training facility in Breslau. Funding for Dog Guide training is 100 per cent obtained from private donations, Lions clubs, service clubs, foundations and corporations, with no government funding.  

Dog Guide Training:
- Training is completed over a period of six to eight months;
- Once a Dog Guide is fully trained, the dog is matched with a client who stays at the training school in Oakville for 10 to 26 days, depending on the program; and 
- Trainers work one-on-one with clients and dogs to produce qualified Dog Guide teams.

Canine Vision Canada (CVC) Dog Guides: 
- CVC Dog Guides increase the mobility and self-confidence of people who are visually impaired by enabling their handlers to travel safely through crowded areas, traffic and around obstacles.

Hearing Ear Dogs of Canada (HED) Dog Guides: 
- HED Dog Guides are trained to alert deaf or hard-of-hearing handlers to sounds they cannot detect, such as the telephone ringing, the doorbell, a child crying, the calling of their name and the sound of an activated fire alarm.

Special Skills (SSD) Dog Guides: 
- SSD Dog Guides are trained to turn off and on light switches, open and close doors and drawers, retrieve items dropped such as a pencil or keys and get help should assistance be required; and  
- The constant companionship of a trusted canine partner brings independence to the lives of disabled Canadians. 

The Lions Foundation of Canada Breeding Facility, Breslau, ON
- Lions Foundation of Canada breeding facility provides quality puppies for the development of future Dog Guides. Generous breeders often donate puppies as well as breeding stock; and 
- The most successful breeds for Dog Guide training include Labrador Retrievers, Standard and Miniature Poodles and Border Terriers.

The Foster Puppy Program 
- The Foster Puppy Program is very important to the early development and training of Dog Guides; 
- Qualified volunteers provide homes for puppies where, for the first 10 to 14 months of their life, they learn proper house manners, and are socialized and exposed to many different situations; and  
- The Foundation covers routine medical and veterinary expenses and Nestlé Purina PetCare provides the food.

Purina Walk for Dog Guides
- The Purina Walk for Dog Guides is the Lions Foundation of Canada's annual major fundraising initiative;  
- Since the inaugural event in 1985, the Purina Walk for Dog Guides has grown to include more than 100 community walks across Canada during the months of May, June, September and October; and 
- To date, the Purina Walk for Dog Guides has raised more than $20 million in support of Dog Guide training programs.

COMMENTS: Our mission is to save the lives of abused and unwanted American Eskimo dogs in the St. Louis area. We are a group of dedicated volunteers, working together for the benefit of helpless and homeless Eskies. Our program is funded by donations and adoption fees. Our volunteers spend endless hours of rescue work which involves transporting, fostering, and networking to save American Eskimo lives.

Adoption from American Eskimo Rescue/Heartbandits includes medical attention that each rescue dog deserves, including all vaccinations, spay/neuter, fecal check, heartworm check, and microchip. These rescue Eskies are then placed in loving foster homes until their forever home is found.

Rescued animals often make the best pets. Pets from American Eskimo Rescue seem to understand they have a second lease on life. In return for a little affection and attention, these remarkable animals reward their new owners with a love and loyalty unmatched anywhere.

If you would like to adopt a lovable Eskie, please fill out and mail in an Application for Adoption. If you would like to become a foster home, please fill out and mail in a Foster Home Application. You can find these forms here on-line or call 314-647-1112.
 
The loving dog you will adopt will be spayed or neutered, all necessary vaccinations, checked for heartworm, and all medical conditions as necessary. Eskies 1 yr. and under will have an adoption fee of $200, all other adoption fees are $175. This fee covers some of these medical expenses.

The purpose of this international event is to raise the public's awareness of the wonder and magic of Greyhounds as pets, educate others on the current status of Greyhounds around the world and to honor those Greyhounds who have left us already. The St. Louis event will be a celebration at The Boathouse in Carondelet Park at Loughborough and I55, on Sunday, September 18, 2005, from 3 to 6 pm. There will be information about greyhound adoption with grey related demonstrations.  Erin O'Neill, of Newschannel 5, has agreed to emcee the program.  Of course, there will be food, vendor booths, children's activities, nail trims, contests, raffles, door prizes, music, a group picture in front of The Boathouse with a fountain and the sunset in the background, a blessing of the hounds, a roo, fun for the whole family, available fosters to view,  a candle lighting in honor of all greys, past and present, and more.   AVID ID Systems will provide a vet to hold a Microchip Clinic that will cost $20.00 or $15.00 each for 2 or more (a $60.00 Value).  All leashed greyhounds are welcome.  Bring a lawn chair or blanket.  Adopters and their greys will be on The Window on Newschannel 5 on Thursday, 9/15, at 6 am and 3 pm.

COMMENTS: I have alot of background in dog training and behaviour. Also, I have helped  saved many dogs from being euthanized at various animal shelters by taking the time they may not have had, and researching and finding new homes for the "hard to place" dogs at shelters and pounds. I have been certified in dog training school but it goes way beyond the "basic training". In my experience the dogs that really needed saving and rehab for placement are the ones that the shelters would not adopt out for as they say "liability" reasons. In other words, not to blame them, they need to protect their organizations, but the dogs need to be socialized and retrained or rehabbed and they are understaffed and volunteers have to abide by their rules.  I have a circle of experienced dog loving people who have found each other through the same concerns and venues. Trying to help the so called "impossible dog" to place in just any homes. The dogs have failed the infamous" temp tests" that are OFTEN times given by inexperienced shelter staff and their "trainers"! Many dogs I have seen be destroyed because they gave the "whale eye" to a "trainer" who then would fail the dog, and therefore, well, the dog was put down because he may have been misjudged by an inexperienced person. I am not saying that all tests are bad I am just saying that you canot predict a dogs behaviour all the time, so why not consider the circumstances and give the dog another chance? I realize that this is a debate that could go on forever. So, I would rather help by helping people who need help with dogs, and dogs that need help with their people. If I am not qualified I will not pretend to know all, I will simply direct you to who may help you. MY  intention is to help keep people from making the devasating decision to surrender their beloved pet to a shelter or vice-versa, have pets get adopted and then go back to the shelter just to be bounced around or worse "yes worse" euthanized. 

OK, This is why I want to hopefully be added to this board for DogFriendly.com

Thanks
I offer FREE TRAINING , that why I am here. Thankyou!!

I decided that it was time to have a all breed meet up group! I am currently a member of both the NYC and Dumplin' Chihuahua meet up groups. I noticed that there was no group where all different breeds could come (as long as they were the same size)together and play, most being breed specific! Well I thought, what about those members who don't have such a popular group and don't get to socialize there pup's because of it?!?! And what about the mixed breed and rescue pup's that will never have a group of their own? I myself have a mixed breed small dog, she is an 8lb. Chihuahua/Pekingese mix and she likes all kinds of doggies!

Animals in our care are placed in foster homes while they receive medical 
attention and lots of love until they are up for adoption. We assist the public with re-homing their pets as well as finding the perfect pet for those who are wishing to provide a permanent home for an unwanted animal. We are also available to assist shelters and rescue groups who are overwhelmed and need to find placements for some of their animals. We offer once/month adopt-a-thons as well as extra publicity for rescue groups and local shelters. Our goal is to help animals in-transition so they do not end up in dangerous situations and to provide assistance to shelters if an animal is in danger of euthanasia or needs special attention. We can support shelters and frustrated families by being a resource for training, veterinary help or contacting rescues.

We at Rescue Me, Incorporated believe that the high cost of a medical procedure should not determine if an animal should live or die. We are also involved heavily in animal rescue, rehabilitation and placement. We are very careful in the placement of our animals. It is our job and responsibility to see that our animals go to the perfect life-long, loving home. We have a very extensive and careful screening process to insure that our animals find the perfect forever home. One of our goals is to help cut the euthanasia rate by educating the public on the importance of animal rescue and spay/neuter programs. Together, Forever and Always for the Animals.

We are a very small shelter and finding funds to keep us going is a great effort, as we are located in a low income county. Each day we struggle to keep our doors open. We have many dedated volunteers and a small decated staff of nine. They work long hours to provide care for our many animals.

COMMENTS: From its busy shelter in the heart of Honolulu, the Hawaiian Humane Society is a focal point of Oahu's animal community and plays an ever-evolving role as mediator on the changing relationship between people and animals. Since 1897, the Hawaiian Humane Society has reached out to those who enjoy and employ animals, as well as those people who love and share their lives with them. As an animal welfare organization, the Society is also very much a people business; supporting and promoting the human-animal bond, educating young and old, finding solutions to the challenges of a diverse and fast-growing community. The Society's mission--to teach and promote the humane treatment of all living creatures--is a joyful one full of challenges and opportunities. Count on the Hawaiian Humane Society for adoptions, advice, an off-leash dog park, and a wide variety of programs that support the human-animal bond.

We stand behind every one of our dogs for their lifetime, meaning if for any reason their adoptive home could not keep them, they must come back into our program.  We also offer courtesy posts for anyone who needs their English Setter rehomed.  We do all the leg work to make sure the placement is a good one.

COMMENTS: Our mission is to rescue Great Danes from neglect, abuse, and abandonment. To provide medical care and individual rehabilitation through our experienced and loving foster home program. To provide each rescued Dane with a qualified, caring new home that will ensure a quality of life each Dane has deserved from the day it was born. We have been rescuing Great Danes in the D/FW/Denton area since 1998 and we take pride in the collective love, concern and dedication for the throw-away Danes here. It is our mission to continue to hear the voices of the less fortunate Danes, and to provide them safety, protection and their birthright of a quality of life with love and dignity.
 To fund raise for Great Dane rescue efforts.
 To assist needy owners that cannot afford spaying, neutering, or heartworm treatment. Until the time that the funds are plentiful, this can be facilitated by SNYP discount coupons (Spay/Neuter Your Pet), which we can provide, and by providing locations of lowest cost vet services in the Metroplex, including the very low cost Humane Society of the United States discount spay/neuter clinic in Oak Cliff.
To educate the public with information on topics such as spay/neuter benefits, vaccinations, backyard breeding, behavior, obedience and nutrition.
To sponsor informal seminars and discussion groups on any of the above Dane-related topics.
To refer people to responsible breeders.
To sponsor walks and events to raise awareness of rescue needs and the plight of Metroplex Danes.
To be a link point to other rescues and clubs nationwide.
 To be a focal and support point for Dane owners to seek information and guidance about Dane-related topics. 
100% of all donated funds go directly to the Medical costs, feeding, equipment, and other direct costs of rescuing Great Danes. There are no overhead costs such as staffing of offices, salaries, etc. 
Thank you for your generosity!

COMMENTS: Every year we host a very large dog festival. The squamish Dog festval is a celebration of all dogs in our lives from the pampered house pet to the working dogs that make out lives easier. The festival raises money for the "my best freind fund" which is a fund that helps pay for low income families or individuals who have emergency vet bills. We feel that nobody should lose a best freind due to cash flow issues. The fund will also be used for spay/nueter programs in the community. This year the festival is on August 27th, 10 to 4 Logger Sports grounds Squamish B.C.Canada. For information please call 604-898-1367.

COMMENTS: You have probably seen dock jumping on ESPN's Great Outdoor Games and now we have an organization dedicated to furthering the sport in our own area. In dock jumping, everyone is a winner!  There is no right breed of dog, age or weight of dog.  The only thing you need is a dog that likes water and loves to have fun!  If your dog plays in the water until she drops at the local park or your own lakefront, this is a sport for you! You can't fail!  your dog can't fail!

COMMENTS: Friends Of Wayne Animals (FOWA)aslo known as the WAyne Animal Shelter, is a non-profit organization.  We are a group of about 30 volunteers who runs and maintains the WAyne Animal Shelter in Wayne, NJ.  The cost to run this shelter is $150,000 a year in which Wayne Township provides us with 17% of that money.  We raise the rest by our fundraising events.
FOWA's primary mission is to operate the Wayne Township municipal animal shelter.
FOWA works to assure the humane treatment of dogs and cats in the Township of Wayne and to stimulate the public's awareness of and interest in the growth, improvement, and development of the Wayne Animal Shelter and its community programs.
Each year FOWA saves the lives of about 1,100 animals through its aggressive adoption, spay/neuter, community outreach, and humane educational programs.
FOWA depends upon charitable donations to care for the helpless, homeless pets that come through its doors.
Donations, either in the form of funds, needed supplies, or volunteer services, are critical to FOWA's success.
Our mission is to care for all the homeless animals in Wayne until they are adopted into a loving home.  We currently have less than 1% euthanazia rate and less than 1 % return rate on adoptions.

COMMENTS: We are a nationwide network of transport volunteers, temporary Foster homes, rescues, animal shelters and transport coordinators. We drive cars, vans, SUVs, Semi Trucks and RVs. RollingRescue or their volunteers DO NOT charge for this service, but can accept donations of food and/or supplies to help make their transport go smoothly.RollingRescue is not a place to post animals that are in need of rescues / homes, fund raisers, DNA's or other non transport related subjects. It is not a place where breeders or other commercial entities can get free transport. We DO NOT deal with "Class-B" collectors or Medical Research facilities. Private individuals seeking to be reunited with a pet following a family crisis or seeking to adopt from an out-of-area rescue or shelter may request transport assistance and we will work to find a transport coordinator to assist them, but as a rule, private individuals in these situations don't coordinate their own transports and do not need to join the list unless they have a desire to become an ongoing transport volunteer. Adopters will be screened by the shelter, the transport coordinator or a rescue in their local area and all animals moved to such homes must be spayed or neutered, up to date on shots and tested for Heart Worm and other parasites. We will help to make the necessary arrangements. The network exists to make all of that possible. We will not move an animal that is not vetted to an unscreened adopter. Rescues being assisted in transporting animals to themselves will also be screened.

COMMENTS: Greyhound Adoption of Ohio is the largest (based on number of dogs placed) and oldest (based on incorporation date) greyhound adoption organization in the state of Ohio. At the time of our inception, in 1993, greyhounds were rarely seen in Ohio. Today, you'll see greyhounds nearly everywhere you go! The word is out! Greyhounds make WONDERFUL pets! GAO receives dogs from numerous tracks around the country, but primarily from Florida , Wisconsin and Kansas . We generally have 25-30 dogs awaiting placement at any given time. Upon arrival at GAO, each dog is neutered, vaccinated, checked for parasites, heartworm tested, microchipped and has a complete dental cleaning. Anything else the future pet may need is done prior to placement. Occasionally, GAO will receive a dog with a fractured leg, an injury that is quite common in the world of greyhound racing. These dogs receive excellent care through Ohio State University 's orthopedic surgery center. Our goal, at GAO, is to place our greyhounds with loving, committed families where they will live safe and secure for the rest of their lives. To that end, GAO offers support to help your dog transition into his or her new life and throughout the life of your pet. We welcome you to the wonderful world of retired racing greyhounds! May it be as rewarding for you as it is for us!

COMMENTS: Who We Are
Animal Rescue Volunteers, Inc. is a non-profit organization that began in 1994. We are all volunteers who love animals and wish to make a difference by helping end the pet over population problem and rescuing abandoned animals. We are a well respected, long-standing organization that provides this service to the Simi Valley Community as well as the larger | Ventura and Los Angeles County areas.
What We Do
We feed, house, spay/neuter, microchip and provide medical care for animals that have been rescued from animal shelters, or from a natural disaster, in addition to providing positive reinforcement training and behavior modification for harder to place dogs.  We hold weekly adoptions to find the very best home for each animal. Prospective adoptive families fill out an application, and are interviewed. An ARV volunteer then visits the applicant's home to assure it is safe for the animal. 
Our Accomplishments
ARV has been instrumental in the adoption of over 4,400 animals since 1994. We continually provide veterinary care for rescued animals such as assistance for broken jaws, hip and leg fractures, upper respiratory illnesses, cancer treatment, mange, vision impairment, infections, and heart problems while they are awaiting adoption. We even bought a pacemaker for ARV's mascot, Hannah, who is no longer with us. We provide animal "well-care" such as shots and grooming. To date we have provided over $250,000 for this care. We have also paid the required fees to rescue animals from Animal Control Agencies.

PHONE: 301-934-3616  
COMMENTS: Beagle Rescue of Southern Maryland, Inc., or Beagle MarylandTM,  is a nonprofit corporation founded in April 2001, which helps and finds homes for beagles in need.  Our beagles come to us as strays, from shelters, as owner surrenders - and we do all we can to help every beagle in need of help who crosses our path.  All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, current on shots, heartworm negative and microchipped before they go to a permanent home.  It is our primary goal that our beagles, many of whom have had unhappy lives before they came to us, are given the best chance at finding their forever families.  Toward that end, dogs are placed in permanent homes that meet our Standards for Adoption.
Beagle Maryland is completely run by volunteers.  All of our dogs are fostered at private homes (we do NOT have a shelter or kennel), and we do our best to insure that our dogs are ready to go to new homes, as well as that their homes are as prepared as they can be to welcome their new family member.  When you are trying to contact us, please remember that our volunteers work full-time jobs and have families, in addition to working with Beagle Maryland - and that, when we come home at the end of the day, we have to feed beagles (and there are often LOTS of beagles) before we can start to return e-mails or phone calls.  We WILL get back to you - just not immediately!

COMMENTS: 
Make Peace With Animals is a non-profit, all-volunteer organization dedicated to finding peaceful solutions to the many problems facing animals. One way we express this is by finding homes for former racing Greyhounds. Since we do not have a kennel, all of our pets are either in foster homes or at a costly boarding kennel. 
We placed our first Greyhound in 1988 and, since then, have found homes for over 4,000 others. All of this has been accomplished by an extraordinarily dedicated group of volunteers. None of our staff is paid and most have full-time jobs. Nonetheless, the defining characteristic of our group is the individual care each adopter receives, both before and after the adoption. We take great pains to match the right person with the right dog. If there needs to be some fine-tuning after the fact, we are there for you. If unforeseen circumstances require you to return a dog, we gladly accept him or her back; in fact, we insist on it!

We sponsor the annual Blessing of the Animals, and also have information booths at the Sun Valley Art Fair and the Ketchum Art Fair during July and August.  There is an on-call veterinarian and paid staff, plus volunteers.  Dog walks are held each Wednesday from 9:30 am till 1 pm, out Adams Gulch, two miles north of the City of Ketchum (which is very dog-friendly), where people can sign out shelter dogs for walks, hikes and runs.  The public is also encouraged to check out and walk dogs at the shelter, which is away from public streets.  During the winters, the dog walks are held a mile east of Sun Valley resort, on Trail Creek road, also from 9:30 till 1 pm, depending on the weather..not during blizzards or rainy/sleety weather.  An event called "Pole & Paw" is held in on a saturday in February, in which people can nordic ski "race" with their dogs at the Sun Valley golf course, located on Trail Creek road, on the eastern boundary of the Sun Valley resort.  There are many hiking and biking trails and paths in the area,with two creeks and the Big Wood River, where the dogs are free to roam and frolic in the water.  Many canyons, located on Bureau of Land Management land, are within a five to thirty mile distance, and  the Sawooth National Recreational Area begins just eleven miles north of Ketchum, and is open to dogs, unlike in National Parks.  I have lived in Ketchum, Idaho for almost 37 years, and I've had dogs for 31 years in canine paradise.

COMMENTS: Greyhound Outreach (G.O.) was started in 2001 and is dedicated to finding loving homes for ex-racing greyhounds. Although greyhound racetracks abound throughout the United States, Florida has more tracks than any other state in the nation. This has led to an overabundance of greyhounds needing homes in that area, and Florida is saturated to beyond the breaking point. Greyhound Outreach helps move these dogs up the Eastern Seaboard and into loving homes in upstate New York. Greyhound Outreach is also dedicated to educating the public about what wonderful pet these dogs make! Affectionate, gentle, and clean, the loving greyhound is a fantastic companion.  If you are interesting in adopting a greyhound, learning more about the breed, or would like to find out about our local events and/or volunteer, we invite you to explore our new website and contact us! G.O. also is extremely thankful for any donations coming into the group. Everything is for the benefit and promotion of these extraordinary dogs! Whether it's going on a walk with other greyhound owners, chatting on the community e-group or volunteering to help more hounds with G.O., there are many ways to be a part of the larger greyhound community here in Central New York!

COMMENTS: Abandoned. Neglected. Abused. Lost.  At AGAPE, we have seen it all when it comes to man's friend.  But despite the misfortunes these animals have endured, our commitment to them remains steadfastly clear: to provide loving, emotionally stable, nurturing foster care for them while they wait for their forever homes, for their forever families.
Through no fault of their own, our dogs found themselves in homeless situations. We are dedicated to making a positive difference in these dogs' lives from the moment they enter our foster program.  Our goal is to help these animals in every way we can...emotionally, socially, physically…so that the transition onto their forever homes will be as smooth as possible.  We strive to teach our dogs basic obedience skills, including proper leash manners and friendly house manners.  
On behalf of all the dogs waiting for a forever family, we thank you for your interest in improving the lives of these deserving animals.  To find out more about our adoptable dogs, visit www.agaperescue.org.

COMMENTS: Our mission is to serve the pets and people of Calvert County by operating a state of the art animal adoption and education center.
Our goal is to provide a friendly, caring environment
to promote the adoption of unwanted, homeless
animals and to be able to support these animals until they are adopted.
Our vision is to develop resources that allow us to offer educational programs that clearly define responsible pet care and respect for all animals.
VISIT OUR CENTER!
We are an ALL Volunteer, Non-Profit Rescue Group
The Calvert Animal Adoption & Education Center is open every Friday - Sunday, from 11am - 3pm for Adoptions/Open House.
The center is located at 1040 Theater Drive in Prince Frederick (across from the Maryland VEIP station).
We have a limited-intake facility that can house over 30 cats/kittens and up to 9 dogs, as well as additional animals in our network of foster homes. Because we limit the number of pets in our care, we can dedicate ourselves to giving each one of them more time and attention, resulting in healthier, calmer animals. CAWL has set up a Behavior Help Center that provides educational materials (brochures, books, videos, DVDs) free of charge to anyone who needs help. We also offer in-house obedience classes through Canine Mind, LLC, and behavioral consultations with Certified Pet Dog Trainers who are qualified to assist with problems ranging from housetraining to rude behavior to aggression.

PHONE: 866-GEB-LABS
COMMENTS: The Canine Development Center is an exciting place, where the first steps are taken toward producing a successful guide dog team: breeding, birthing, socializing, screening and placing high- potential puppies in loving, nurturing puppy raising homes. The puppies are bred to maximize the qualities required in a working guide dog and minimize any health problems that would disrupt or shorten a guide dog's working years. These are very special puppies - the result of many generations of selective breeding. Approximately half of the puppies go on to be working guide dogs. However, every pup is valued and goes on to find his or her place in the world; as a guide dog or another type of service dog, or as a loving pet in a carefully screened home. 
The Canine Development Center is a wonderful place for dog lovers but, beyond that, a place where your efforts go toward producing one-half of a working guide team, giving the human member of the team a more independent life and devoted companion.

TITLE: Foster Grand Parent Program
PHONE: (360)7500-7500    x393
COMMENTS: The Foster Grandparent Program provides opportunities for low-income seniors to contribute to their community as they engage children at risk on a one-to-one basis in various school and non-profit settings. 
Foster Grandparents are seniors, age 60 and older, who are living at, or below, 125% of poverty.  We pay them a small tax exempt stipend per hour and they serve twenty or more hours a week at their volunteer site.
We have served our area since 1977.  In that time there have been over 35,000 children served.  Our program places seniors, with a life time of 
experience with children who need some one who has the time and is willing to listen to them.  
Time with Grandma or Grandpa is sometimes the only consistent part of a child's life.  The value of intergenerational programs has long been established.  Our seniors, this country's only growing resource, have the hugs, words of encouragement and smiles that help to celebrate each child's success. 
The base funding for this program is federal and is currently being cut to the point that continuing our services in this community are at risk unless we can find sponsors and funders who believe in our mission and will support this program on an annual basis.
&#61558;	We serve many Elementary Schools. 
&#61558;	Foster Grandparents work one-on-one on daily lessons to help bring these children up to grade level. 
&#61558;	Children with professionally identified special or exceptional need are the children our program works with. 
&#61558;	There are Foster Grandparent Programs all around the nation. Currently over 35,000 seniors are involved in this intensive effort to help bring children's performance up to their grade levels.  There are statistics to back up the importance of reading as a key to successful learning. 
Our program is a part of the Corporation for National and Community Service and is legislated under the Domestic Volunteer Services Act along with two other senior programs and VISTA.  The program originated 41 years ago to show the value of intergenerational programming.  President Johnson created the Foster Grandparent Program as a part of the War on Poverty programs.  
And so it is that we are asking for your sponsorship of our fundraiser to assure that these low-income seniors and at-risk children are able to continue their relationships for years to come.  With school budgets being cut, our services become even more important in equipping young people to become the self-sufficient citizens of tomorrow.

Although greyhound racetracks abound throughout the United States, Florida has more tracks than any other state in the nation. This has led to an overabundance of greyhounds needing homes in that area, and Florida is saturated to beyond the breaking point. Greyhound Outreach, Inc. helps move these dogs up the Eastern Seaboard and into loving homes in upstate New York.
Greyhound Outreach, Inc. is also dedicated to educating the public about what wonderful pet these dogs make. Affectionate, gentle, and clean, the loving greyhound is a fantastic companion.  G.O. currently holds bi-monthly Meet & Greets where G.O. representatives, volunteers and adopters work to get the word out about what great pets retired racers can make. G.O. presents educational talks at schools through the Central New York area as well as sponsoring numerous fundraising events.

TITLE: HeavenSent Bulldog Rescue
PHONE: 609-234-0916
COMMENTS: The only rescue in the State of New Jersey dedicated to English Bulldogs, HeavenSent Bulldog Rescue is a volunteer group of bulldog lovers whose mission is to re-home bulldogs who are surrendered by their owners or find themselves otherwise without homes, landing in animal shelters or wandering the streets as strays.  Volunteers provide foster care, veterinary care and rehabilitation for these needy dogs, ultimately finding them forever homes.  While HeavenSent places rescued bulldogs primarily with families in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, bulldogs from the surrounding areas are rescued as well, including those in New York, Delaware, and Maryland. In 2006, HeavenSent rescued and placed more than 50 bulldogs. HeavenSent is not a shelter facility!  Foster care for bulldogs in transition is provided in the private homes of HeavenSent's volunteers, who receive no compensation for their time.  Many volunteers, by choice, spend their own money to provide toys, treats, food, grooming and beds for the dogs entrusted to their care. HeavenSent is not a paid network, is not affiliated (see our non-affiliation statement below) with any purebred dog club or other for-profit organization, and does not operate under any type of charitable program providing funds for veterinary care.  HeavenSent relies solely on donations and fundraisers to finance veterinary exams, inoculations, medications, and surgical procedures including routine spaying/neutering as well as life-enhancing and, sometimes, life-saving surgery.  Donations also help pay for food, bedding, grooming supplies, bowls, vitamins and other supplements.  HeavenSent Bulldog Rescue is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization and a New Jersey Nonprofit corporation. For more information on bulldog rescue & adoption in the New Jersey/ Pennsylvania /Delaware /Maryland/New York area, if you know of a Bulldog in need or would like to volunteer, please contact:
Joanne Hale: 609-234-0916, Cathy Kittell: 732-681-3881, Kara Gordon: 215-514-9818.
Non-Affiliation Statement:  There are no strings attached to membership in HeavenSent Bulldog Rescue, a NJ Nonprofit Corporation.  HeavenSent is not affiliated with the Bulldog Club of America Rescue Network or any other organization, we have no initiation fees or dues, and we do not require members to belong to any other organization in order to participate in our rescue efforts. Although in the past we thought that affiliation with a purebred dog group would be necessary in order to best serve the bulldogs who come into our care, we have actually found, to our surprise and delight, that our existence as an independent, 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization allows us the freedom to focus on the well-being of the bulldogs without the burden of politics and rules that would require us to actually endanger the bulldogs or disrespect any of our members.  At HeavenSent Bulldog Rescue, we believe that if you want to help, we need you, because the bulldogs need all the help they can get, regardless of your politics or other beliefs; we treat all members with respect and dignity. Our primary purpose is to help bulldogs in need, and we do not believe that we "deserve" any kind of reward or recognition for doing so - we believe that the work itself is the reward. We strongly believe that egos have no place in rescue.  HeavenSent's non-affiliation policy allows us to do what we feel is right for the bulldogs in our care, without political constraint or the need for some uninterested or uninformed party's approval.   We make our own decisions, with the best interests of the bulldogs at heart - and that's all!!  For us, It's ALL about the bulldogs.

TITLE: Las Vegas Weimaraner Club & Rescue
PHONE: 702-280-6946
COMMENTS:  The purpose of the Las Vegas Weimaraner Club Rescue Program is to take Weims in need of homes, rehabilitate them, and find loving new homes for these wonderful dogs. Our goal is to give as many lost, neglected and abandoned Weims as possible a second chance at a good life. Often through no fault of their own, Weimaraners are turned over to us because of lifestyle changes of their owners.  The owners divorce, move to an apartment, have a baby, etc. and can no longer care for their Weimaraner. Also animal shelters throughout the state receive Weimaraners for various reasons also.  These shelters know of our Rescue Program and call us when they get a Weimaraner. Sometimes Weims are found running loose and are turned over to us. Why adopt an adult dog? Weimaraner puppies, as cute as they are, are notorious for causing havoc as they go through the housebreaking, chewing, and basic learning stages.   Rescued Weims make wonderful companions. They seem grateful for a new life. How do I adopt a Weimaraner? In order to adopt a dog from our Rescue Program, an adoption application must be completed.  This application can be found on our website under the Rescue Section. How long does it take to adopt a Weimaraner? The length of the adoption process depends on the availability of dogs in our Rescue Program that meet your particular needs. Some Rescue dogs are placed within weeks of being received in our program. Others stay in the program for months as they recover from previous neglect or abuse.  Whatever time the dog needs to be rehabilitated is determined by the individual dog. A donation of $250 is requested for each adopted Weimaraner. The donation will go to help pay for Vet & Boarding bills for the weims in rescue and to help with saving future weims.

TITLE: Nebraska Italian Greyhound Rescue
PHONE: 
COMMENTS: To outline our adoption program, we require a fenced yard in most cases, the dog must be an indoor pet and a member of the family and you must have time to give the dog the attention it requires and deserves. Italian Greyhound Rescue is an organization that receives Italian Greyhounds who have been turned in for various reasons with housebreaking issues and "not knowing the breed" being at the top. Italian Greyhounds are typically, very sensitive and 'needy', they want to connect to their owners and be part of their lives....if the dog is unhappy and misunderstood, the owner will also be unhappy.
Prospective adopters are required to fill out an application, provide references and go through a brief interview process, including a home visit.....the visit is simply a social call to meet the family and other pets and to see the home environment....all of this helps us match the right dog to your situation and needs as well as theirs. We always strive for successful, permanent placements and in assessing your family and home we are better able to determine if a particular dog will 'fit' into your life based on their temperament and personality, which is to your advantage.
We require a donation with each adoption and the adoptee must sign a simple adoption contract. These donations are returned to the Italian Greyhound Rescue Fund to provide medical care for future rescue dogs. All dogs are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, tested for heartworms and on preventative, teeth cleaned if necessary and any other medical concerns addressed as determined by a veterinarian. Vet records are provided and we reveal as much of the dogs history, personality and health as is known to us.

COMMENTS: Every year thousands of animals are euthanized or sent home to die because the people who love them cannot afford the cost of veterinary care. Stray and abandoned animals have even fewer options when they are brought into a clinic or veterinary office with no owner to pay for their care.
At The Bella Foundation, we believe that every animal should receive the best possible care regardless of the owner&#8242;s ability to pay. When an owner brings an animal into a clinic for care and cannot afford the cost, the attending veterinarian can contact The Bella Foundation for assistance. If assistance is given, the owner must agree to volunteer at least 8 hours of their time at the The Oklahoma City Animal Shelter or their local shelter. Stray or abandoned animals are cared for with no stipulation attached.

Each year we take in nearly 10,000 lost, abandoned, injured and neglected animals. Every animal is given a complete medical exam and tested for disease, spayed or neutered, vaccinated and given a microchip. There is no time limit for an animal to stay at the Animal Rescue League. The Animal Rescue League functions to provide shelter, medical services, care and protection for homeless and neglected companion animals. By advocating for their welfare, community involvement and education we are striving to end the euthanasia of healthy, adoptable animals in Palm Beach County.

OBG rescues cockers and cocker mixes of all ages (both young and old) directly from owners or from shelters.  We also arrange for dogs in other rescue organizations, or still with their owners, to be posted on our courtesy page.  OBG loves all animals, but by focusing on Cockers we are able to efficiently free up shelter space around the DC area which benefits all homeless dogs.

COMMENTS: North Coast Greyhound Connection has entered it's 3rd year and is going strong!  One of our specialties is taking in special needs greyhounds.  We have special foster families who care for these dogs, mostly broken limbs, until they are healed then NCGC finds them their forever home.  It is very rewarding work.  We also take in a large percentage of senior dogs (7 yrs. and over) to find homes for.  Since a Greyhounds life span is 12-15 yrs there is still plenty of time to enjoy with these special Greys, and boy do they deserve it.  There are also plenty of youngsters to be found at NCGC too!  Some come straight off the track while others have been in the "Second Chance at Life" program, which is a prison training program.  Once they have graduated they know "sit", "down", "shake" and other commands.  Please consider adopting a Greyhound today.

COMMENTS: Greyhound Lifesavers Inc., formerly GHL Greyhound Adoptions, consists of greyhound owners from Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. We are dedicated to finding homes for retired racing greyhounds. We have extensive experience in caring for greyhounds and we love matching people and greyhounds. We work with greyhound farms and adoption representatives at several Florida racing tracks to place dogs in desperate need of a loving home. Are you our next GL home? Contact us if you can open your home to a retired racing greyhound - you won't be sorry.
We place each "fresh from service" greyhound into a foster home for a minimum of three weeks to ease the transition from living in a kennel to living in a home. During that time, each of our greyhounds receives a thorough veterinary exam that includes shots, heartworm testing, teeth cleaning, and spay/neuter service. We also micro-chip each dog. We then test to see if the greyhound is cat-safe, small dog-safe, and child-safe. We want these greyhounds to succeed in their new homes.
Interested in adopting? Visit http://www.greyhoundlifesavers.org. Bring a retired racer into your life...you won't ever be the same.

TITLE: Green Mtn Pug Rescue
PHONE: 802 626 8280
COMMENTS: Green Mountain Pug Rescue is a 501 (c) (3) non profit rescue group of volunteers within Vermont here to help pugs. They are placed in foster homes with dedicated volunteers for evaluation and vet visits which include: getting them up to date on shots, spaying/neutering them if needed.
Green Mountain Pug Rescue is supported by an all volunteer staff. We are only able to help pugs through the generous monetary donations and volunteer time that people graciously give.
All donations are used to help our pugs. All of the funds donated will help pay for the veterinary care, giving these very deserving pugs back the highest quality of life possible.
You can also specify if you would like to donate funds for public education of the breed and helping us teach others about responsible pug ownership. This would help us with the printing costs of flyers and printed materials.
The purpose of Pug Adoption is to provide a healthy, happy, home for the lifetime of the pug. It is not to provide a low-cost pet. We see adoption as a privilege that families are selected for based on individual merit, not on a first come basis. The adoption fees are used towards support of the pugs. Money is used for vet bills, medicine, food, toys, and other supplies. Absolutely NO money is paid to volunteers for salaries or mileage. Extra funds are used for rescue efforts. All applicants must be legal adults with a means of supporting a pet PLUS any unexpected medical issues. Stability is very important. Many pugs will have one thing or another happen during their lifetime that requires some form of attention. The needs of the pug are most important. Pugs need stable homes quickly. Pugs need to settle in to a home and not to bounce from foster to foster. They need affection and tender loving care. GMPR requires a home visit on every applicant - no exceptions..
GMPR can not guarantee that a pug will be housebroken. Any time an animal enters a new environment it needs to learn where to go potty. It is like any of us entering a place and not knowing where the bathroom is, except pugs can't ask! GMPR cannot make any guarantee of a pug's age. Pugs will not be placed into home with animals that are not altered (unless due to age restrictions). You should care enough about altering as to spay or neuter your animals before applying for adoption. Pugs can not be shipped. Home visits provide a good channel to ask questions. There is no "Pass" or "Fail" to a Home Visit, but feedback is used to help indicate a "best fit" for each individual pug. This long list of rules is a result of circumstances that have happened in our past experiences. Before applying for adoption, please understand what the purpose of adoption is and is not. Misunderstanding can cause delays in finding the right home for a pug or worse.
If you can not comprehend the purpose of adoption, it may not be for you. There are many families that want to open their homes to a pug that needs a "Forever Home". Please respect the needs of pugs by submitting only serious applications. Adoption saves lives! "
After submitting your application, you will be contacted by one of our representatives within 2 weeks. If for some reason you are not contacted within 2 weeks, either email Judy Douglas Foster/Adoption Coordinator at puginmud@msn.com or telephone her at (802) 786-5337
Then a home visit is scheduled to meet with you.

COMMENTS: Akita Rescue, Mid-Atlantic Coast, Inc. (ARMAC), one of the oldest Akita rescue groups in the United States, was founded by a small group of concerned Akita owners and has been serving the Mid-Atlantic seaboard since 1984.  We address a wide variety of Akita needs in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, DC.  Our foster homes are located primarily in the DC Metropolitan Area , but we will offer assistance to anyone who contacts us.   We help educate potential Akita owners and we offer support to Akita owners, not only those who adopt from us, but all Akita owners regardless of where they got their Akita.   
Most importantly, we save the lives of Akitas that would otherwise be euthanized in area shelters.  All of our fostered Akitas are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and temperament tested prior to adoption.  Potential adopters are screened carefully and thoroughly to ensure we have a perfect match between family and Akita. Many adopters are referred to us by our adoptive families, most of whom are repeat adopters and some  are even second generation adopters. Our relationship with them does not stop at adoption: we offer support to them for the lifetime of their Akita and beyond.

When Boxers are in need, Minnesota Boxer Rescue dedicated volunteers respond.  Our mission includes hands-on rescue, as well as education.

When a dog comes into our rescue program they are examined by our vet, brought up to date on vaccinations, heart worm tested, (placed on heart worm preventive medication) and fecal tested.  All dogs are spayed/neutered prior to adoption.  We evaluate each Boxer's personality and temperament, so he/she can be placed in the best home suited for that dog.  If you are interested in adopting, the first step is to submit an application.  You must live in Minnesota in order to adopt.  However, if you live in another state, we would be able to assist you with a contact person and telephone number of another rescue in that state.  Have a little Wiggle Room? Adopt a Boxer Today!

COMMENTS: The Mid-Atlantic Great Dane Rescue League, Inc. (MAGDRL) was organized in 1979 to serve the seven states of the Mid-Atlantic region. The organization is a DC corporation and has a charitable tax-exemption under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
MAGDRL is staffed completely by volunteers. Like all humane groups, MAGDRL is in the unique position of helping both humans and pets. In our case, the pets are Great Danes and mixed Dane dogs, and the people are those who have or want the companionship of the breed or, often, just dogs in general.
MAGDRL helps people to:
Determine the right breed of dog for their lifestyle. 
Find healthy and companionable Danes that fit their circumstances. 
Find loving replacement homes for Danes they can no longer keep. 
Become knowledgeable about the care and training of their Great Danes. 
Resolve their Danes physical/behavioral problem. 
Overcome the grief at the loss of their loved pet. 
Stretch their tax dollar by assuming the Dane burden from public shelters.
 
MAGDRL helps Danes:
By providing for the rescue and care of those who have been abandoned, neglected, and/or abused by their previous owners. 
We spay/neuter and provide medical treatment as necessary to return the Dane back to good health. 
We also supply training/socialization to ensure their adaptability to new, good homes. 
We work to place rescue Danes to people who provide secure, loving, and healthy homes.

COMMENTS: Papillon Pals Rescue is a non-profit 501(c)(3), volunteer organization dedicated to helping small dogs who have been abused, neglected, abandoned, or surrendered by their owners...OR who have found themselves at a shelter, looking for a new home. On rare occasions we also take in dogs that are part of a pair. We serve families in the Southeast, though our home office is based in Jacksonville, Florida our rescue efforts are far-reaching! If you are interested in adopting please contact us at papillonmom@papillonpalsrescue.com to locate a rescue representative closer to your own area or click the email link provided below.We strive everyday to find the best home for each and every dog we take into our rescue. This means that we are advocates for the dog first. Prospective adopters should remember this and keep our efforts in mind and try to be patient as we review each application and evaluate each dog's personality to find the BEST possible fit for their "Forever Home". While some dogs stay in foster care for extended periods of time, and others are placed relatively quickly, the AVERAGE stay for one of our rescued dogs is about 6 to 8 weeks. This gives us the opportunity to fully evaluate the dog's individual personality and needs, and also allow us the opportunity to complete our screening process with each interested family.If by chance you are interested in helping our rescue efforts, there are a variety of ways you can do so. Contact us at papillonmom@papillonpalsrescue.com for further information about various volunteer options...OR...you may make a donation to our cause.

COMMENTS: Oregon Dog Rescue is an Oregon nonprofit corporation as a collaboration of rescue volunteers who are dedicated to the well being of dogs put into our care as well as maximizing the potential for a successful adoption for every dog!  We accomplish this by taking in unwanted dogs from shelters and individual owners, carefully observing the dogs in our care and building a plan that will give the dog the tools and confidence to fit into a relationship that will benefit both dog and owner.  We provide helpful information and training to new owners to help with the transition of dog and owner.  We are determined to stay in touch with our adopters to insure a positive outcome for all.  Oregon Dog Rescue is available for dog care seminars to educate the general public in regard to basic dog care, dog training and rescue.Oregon Dog Rescue is currently a resource for several shelters and Humane Societies in our area.  We are contacted by these organizations when they have too many dogs or if they have a dog that is not doing well in a shelter environment.  We evaluate the dog in person and determine whether the dog can be helped by our organization.  We then provide any immediate attention such as baths, haircuts, etc. before placing them in a foster home.  We provide the foster with supplies such as:  a crate, bedding, toys, meds, food and any other items needed.  The foster parent must care for the dog, take the dog to vet appointments if necessary and report their observations to one of the three directors.  This information as well as pictures is displayed on the internet through Petfinder.com and our own website. Dogs are also accepted on a case by case basis from individual owners as well.  We notify veterinarians in the area who may be treating dogs that the owners can no longer care for.  Our posting on Petfinder.com also brings in calls from individual owners who may need to re-home their dog.  Volunteers also contact posters on the internet as well as newspaper advertisers who are actively looking for a new home for their dog.  They inform the owners of our service and these owners sometimes set an appointment to meet with us in order to take their dog into our organization with the intention of finding the right new home.

COMMENTS: The Concord-Merrimack County SPCA was founded in 1910 to relieve suffering and prevent cruelty to animals and to educate society on the importance of being just and compassionate to all living things.In the 1930s, the agency was one of the original five agencies to form the Community Chest, which has since grown to today's active and highly successful United Way of Merrimack County. Our agency remains a part of the United Way as a designated agency.Our original structure was basically a chicken coop to provide temporary shelter to animals in need. Today we have a 2000 square foot shelter with additional administrative space in a separate building on the property.Our past history reflects a different philosophy of sheltering that was based on animal shelter serving as "warehouses" for homeless animals. Today, our shelter is truly a shelter, with all that word implies in providing safety from the world around us. It is a warm and caring facility for animals in transition, where staff find a loving home for all adoptable animals, no matter how long it may take. And our mission, while basically the same as that back in 1910, is interpreted to require not only on-site care of animals but an active involvement in the community that supports us by serving as a resource to all pet guardians and as an educational voice for our youth. Our programs and services reflect our involvement, our commitment, and our vision.

COMMENTS: Noah’s Ark is a non-profit organization caring for animals for over 40 years. We operate a limited admission facility that operates under an “adoption focused” philosophy, meaning no adoptable pet will be euthanized due age, breed, lack of space or modifiable behavioral issues. Noah’s Ark also operates a Spay-Neuter Hotline that people can call for coupons for reduced spay or neuter services from a network of veterinarians in the community.  Our objective is to find wonderful, forever homes for as many cats and dogs as we can. Last year, approximately 650 cats and dogs found forever homes. Noah’s Ark is a private shelter that receives no state or municipal funding for our operations. We thrive on generous donors and volunteers as well as community outreach programs to promote the fantastic cats and dogs we have up for adoption. It is only through the support of the local businesses and the community that we are able to achieve our goals.

We take in many Labradors which need immediate and/or specialized medical care when others do not.  We alter  each and every dog that comes to us to help reduce the overpopulation of unwanted pets.  Because the Labrador Retriever is the Number 1 dog listed every year in the AKC, we feel it is imperative that we help to stop the overpopulation of Labradors.

COMMENTS: The Delaware Humane Association (DHA)acts as a voice for companion animals and enhances their welfare by providing temporary shelter, spay/neuter services, humane education programs, and adoption/placement resources. Established in 1957 by a group of private citizens, DHA is a non-profit animal welfare organization. Each year, hundreds of animals come to DHA in search of a warm bed, a good meal, and most importantly, a new home. Our dedicated staff and volunteers work hard to ensure that each animal receives the best treatment possible during its stay at our adoption shelter. Staff members go the extra mile to prepare each dog or cat for a new home by keeping them well-groomed, giving them daily exercise and affection, providing obedience training and any necessary medical care.DHA hosts a number of programs which benefit the community, including rabies clinics, educational workshops, pet therapy, and an affordable spay/neuter program. We receive very little government funding. We rely on the support of the community in the form of volunteers, private donations, memberships, bequests, fund-raising events, and our popular Guardian Angel Programs.

COMMENTS: We own a pet store that has dedicated a large portion of our 7,500 to the adoption of rescues.  Ken-Mar Rescue provides the orphans after they have been vet checked, vaccinated, microchipped and spayed or neutered.  Before coming to the store, they stay at Ken or Martie's house (Ken-Mar) for a few days, in order to notate any behavioral issues and make the transition less stressful.  Orphans (we refer to them as guests because they are only visiting until loving committed homes can be found) are housed in large custom made dens and socialized in our day care.  Once a good parent has been found, the orphan is hand delivered to their new home and a thorough home inspection is performed before the final decision is made.  At this point, the New Parent packet is provided, including free bag of food and treats, free grooming, free day care, DVD on how to train a rescue, free personalized id tag and life long registration with a national lost and found registry and other important information.

COMMENTS: The Public Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) was founded in 1976.  We are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization considered to be one of Ohio's most reputable long-standing cat and dog humane rescue groups.  Our group is dedicated to the rescue of pets in Northeastern Ohio. Our mission is to rescue stray and/or abused cats and dogs and place them in good homes. It is a PAWS policy to adopt animals to responsible homes only in the greater Cleveland area. We provide medical care to rescued animals and foster them in our own homes. We also make sure that they are spayed or neutered so that they do not continue the cycle of births that result in more pets than homes. The advantage of adopting a fostered animal is that we know all about our adoptable pets! They have lived with us and we know their personalities, habits, likes and dislikes. We can help you find the perfect companion for your home and lifestyle!   We are a no kill organization (the only time we euthanize is on the advice of a vet in order to end suffering where no hope of recovery exists). Everything we do is out of love for the animals.  PAWS philosophy is that kindness to animals helps build a better world for all of us.  Through the generosity of other caring individuals, we can ensure that animals who come into the care of PAWS will never again be alone, hungry, sick, afraid, or in pain.Our mission is ...To provide for the welfare, medical care, temporary housing, and adoption of dogs and cats in northeast Ohio.To Work for the prevention of cruelty to all animals.To work to form coalitions and working relationships with other local and national humane organizations.To actively create, promote and implement a humane education program.To reduce the over population of cats and dogs in northeast Ohio through education.

COMMENTS: Greyhound Adoption of Ohio is a nonprofit organization that has been dedicated to placing retired racing greyhounds in loving homes for over sixteen years. To date we have placed more than 1600 dogs (who might otherwise have been destroyed) into homes where they have become members of the family. We are very proud of the work we do and the many volunteer hours it takes to provide homes for these amazing animals. Our Mission Statement: Greyhound Adoption of Ohio Was established in January of 1993 to attempt to compensate the wonderful greyhound for the injustices bestowed upon them at the hands of the racing industry. Since our inception, we have placed more than 1000 greyhounds in loving homes. We retrieve retired or rejected greyhounds from the racing kennels, bring them to the kennel and prepare them for their new lives. Upon arrival at GAO, each dog is spayed or neutered, vaccinated, de-wormed, heartworm-tested, receives a thorough dental cleaning, has a microchip implanted for permanent identification and has any other medical care he or she might need. Each dog is then evaluated to determine what type of home will be best for placement. Some of the factors considered include the activity level of each dog and family, whether there are children or other pets in the home, how long the family is away on a daily basis, and whether the family has a history of responsible pet ownership. We strive to ensure these gentle creatures are placed in homes where they will live safe and secure and be loved for the rest of their lives. We believe, however, that adoption is but a "band-aid" on a very large wound. There can never be enough homes for all the dogs in need. For each greyhound that is placed, a dog somewhere will die because that home was taken. With an estimated 10-15 million unwanted animals abandoned or destroyed each year in this country, our goal, in addition to finding loving homes for these kind and gentle creatures, is to make the public aware of the enormity of the pet overpopulation problem and to encourage spaying and neutering of all pets. Therefore, we do not place greyhounds in homes where there are unaltered pets. For many in the racing industry, greyhounds are a disposable commodity, to be discarded when they are no longer able to provide a profit for their owners. We are aware that there are owners and trainers who do take good care of their charges and do everything possible to ensure that they go to responsible adoption organizations when their racing days are over. We endeavor to acknowledge and assist these individuals in their efforts. At Greyhound Adoption, we believe those responsible for the vast over breeding and blatant cruelty that takes place in the sport should be held accountable, and look forward to the day when there will be no need for organizations like ours.

COMMENTS: To many of us a $50.00 medical bill at the vet is nothing, but for an elderly person on a fixed income, a single mother, a student, and for many others, it's an impossibility.There are many instances of elderly people doing without their own medicine or even food in order to care for their animals' medical needs.So what do you do if you love your animal but can't afford to pay the bill-  Shakespeare Animal Fund, a non-profit charity was founded after the loss of a beloved Cocker Spaniel "Shakespeare". He died after a very costly illness, and in his memory this fund was founded to help others who might face financial problems while trying to save their pet.Shakespeare Animal Fund, a non-profit charity was founded after the loss of a beloved Cocker Spaniel "Shakespeare".

COMMENTS: Rocky Mountain Great Dane Rescue, Inc. is recognized as a major resource for the welfare of homeless, abandoned and abused companion animals in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Utah and Wyoming. Our goal is to lower euthanasia rates in our region by: 1. Bringing adoptable pets into our program for medical and social rehabilitation and re-homing. 2. Providing resources to pet owners to encourage their responsibility and commitment to their pets and prevent them from contributing to the homeless pet population. We want to continue to be a valuable resource to our community. We believe that one person can make the difference in the life of an animal in need, so as an organization, we have more strength to help more animals. As part of our mission, RMGDRI firmly believes that it is our responsibility to do all that we can for every Dane that comes into our haven, into our care.

COMMENTS: Tazewell Animal Protective Society (TAPS) Animal Adoption Center and Shelter is a no-kill shelter that gives dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens a home until permanent homes can be found. We are located in Pekin, Illinois, which is just outside of Peoria. Please take a few minutes to look around and meet some of the terrific animals we have up for adoption.For Years the routine killing of healthy dogs and cats just because they are homeless has been an accepted practice. As the no-kill philosophy emerges in America, it is time for the World's wealthiest nation to bring an end to this practice.Animal lovers have long dreamed of the day when there will be no more homeless pets. Located in the Central Illinois town of Pekin and founded in 1958, TAPS is committed to providing a safe environment for homeless pets until they can be placed into permanent, loving homes. We take in and rehabilitate sick and injured pets that have nowhere else to go, and we provide education to pet owners to ensure happier, healthier lives for companion animals. Please send inquiries about adoption, sponsorship, or surrendering a pet to tapsshelter2@yahoo.com.  When surrendering a pet, you will be asked for a donation to cover expenses incurred while the animal is in TAPS' care.Please send any comments or recommendations about our website to taps_webmaster@yahoo.com.

COMMENTS: The IMPS mission is to improve the lives of homeless and abandoned Miniature Pinschers through rescue and the love and respect that comes with humane care, compassion and kindness. IMPS attempts to assist Miniature Pinschers in need by providing foster care, transport, adoptive homes, veterinary care, and other services and information for the well-being of Miniature Pinschers. All Miniature Pinschers placed through IMPS will be spayed or neutered prior to placement, and have been thoroughly evaluated by a breed representative for temperament and training needs. IMPS requires reimbursement of all necessary veterinary costs (eg. the cost of the spay/neuter, microchipping, and any veterinary care required prior to placement), and in some instances, travel costs. A donation to the organization is requested with each adoption so that we may continue to care for chronically ill and/or severely injured foster dogs. In all cases, any expenses related to the adoption will be agreed upon prior to placement. While the Adoption expenses may be negotiable for some dogs, please remember that the care and upkeep of a dog, even the "King of Toys", requires some financial outlay, and if a small placement expense is beyond your means, you may wish to consider a pet which does not require as much care as the Miniature Pinscher.

COMMENTS: Nearly every human loves to go all out for Halloween, so why would your beloved, barking best friend feel any differently Creation Cafe has teamed up with Three Dog Bakery and the Indianapolis Humane Society to bring our city: Barktoberfest.Your pooch won't feel like a zombie during Halloween this year. Barktoberfest - a fundraiser for our furry friends - will be held on the Creation Cafe patio on Saturday, October 10 from noon to 4 p.m.  A red carpet will be rolled out for the costume-clad canines to flaunt themselves in front of the cameras of the 'Puparazzi'. Face painting, a pet psychic, a raffle, and many other wickedly pet-friendly attractions will be on the patio, as well. All funds raised through this event will be donated to the Indianapolis Humane Society. Guests and their pampered pets are also encouraged to check out the Creation Cafe menu - for perhaps a cold beer and a sandwich - and the doggy menu, for their four-legged companions.Creation Cafe is located on the north end of the canal, at 337 W. 11th St. between Senate and Martin Luther King Jr. Dr.BARKTOBER FESTOCTOBER 10TH 12PM-4PM

COMMENTS: Dogs4Diabetics (D4D) is an innovative nonprofit organization that trains assistance dogs to recognize and alert on low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in insulin-dependent diabetics. While blood sugar monitoring continues to be a diabetic's primary tool, D4D dogs provide a critical, early alert to impending, life-threatening drops in blood sugar levels 24-7. With their astonishing sense of smell, D4D dogs can reliably and accurately alert their partners BEFORE they become symptomatic.something even the most advanced medical equipment still cannot do! Granted 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in 2004 and accredited by Assistance Dogs International, Dogs4Diabetics needs your help to continue creating these life-saving partnerships. A program of training, placement and follow-up support is offered to insulin-dependent diabetics free of charge. All D4D dogs live in foster homes until they are placed with their diabetic partner; no D4D dog ever lives in a kennel.

COMMENTS: Animal Alliance, a 501(c) 3 nonprofit charitable organization, is a volunteer organization that rescues animals in immediate danger of euthanasia from several animal shelters. Animal Alliance places animals removed from the shelters into temporary foster care where they are rehabilitated, spayed/neutered, restored to health, and readied for a speedy adoption to carefully chosen adoptive families. Animal Alliance finds euthanasia to be an unacceptable fate for adoptable animals, and strives to educate the public about the surplus of adoptable animals in shelters, the critical importance of spay/neuter, and responsible pet ownership. Through its Planned Pethood Low Cost Spay/Neuter Clinic, Animal Alliance offers spay/neuter outreach services to those who wish to alter their pet but lack the funds to do so.To learn more about Animal Alliance, visit  www.animalalliancenj.org.

Our rescue pulls dogs from high kill gassing shelters in DE, OH, WV, NC, and VA; as well as helping the injured and abandoned animals here in the ocean view area.  Give us your toss aways and we will help change lives.  We take pride in knowing that we are not only helping these animals but also helping you find the perfect pet for your home.We are a 501c3 federally recognized animal rescue, which means that all donations are fully tax deductible.  We accept these donations to offset the costs of our rescue. Our vetting bills alone run thousands each month.  We can only pull dogs if we have the funding to do so.

COMMENTS: Big Dogs - Huge Paws Rescue is a 501c3, non-profit organization comprised of volunteers dedicated to rescuing, rehoming, and rehabilitating unwanted giant breed dogs that have been mistreated, neglected, abused and/or abandoned. We believe giant breeds to be loyal and loving, yet very expensive and sometimes overwhelming due to their massive size and need for constant human attention.Many families do not do proper research and the result is an alarming number of giant breed dogs in need of assistance. Our purpose is to provide a loving foster home and quality food, medical attention, and behavioral training while they are in our care in order to properly evaluate and attend to each dog's special needs. Our ultimate goal is to place each foster dog in a forever home with a family who has demonstrated their ability to provide the necessary love, attention, and care that every gentle giant deserves. We strive to educate owners and potential owners about each unique giant breed's lifestyle, temperament, nutrition, health, and behavioral needs in order to support the breeds and find the perfect match for each rescue dog in our program.

COMMENTS: It is our belief that every Pug should be in an environment where they are loved and safe. Although we do not believe in the puppy mill industry, we also do not believe that any Pug should be faced with a life inside of a puppy mill. We have therefore taken the stance that whenever we have the opportunity to buy a Pug's freedom we will do so. When these Pugs are placed on the auction block or just offered for sale at a puppy mill, other mills are invited to the sale. As a result, the Pug will either be sold or if no other mill wants the Pug, it may be destroyed. It is therefore our belief that although our money does in fact benefi t the mill, it frees the Pug and in some cases saves its life. All pugs are examined by our Veterinarian and treated for any health issues that may be present, immunized against Rabies, Distemper, Corona, Bordetella, microchipped, spay/neutered, Heartworm and Fecal tested. After observing the Pug to determine what type of home best suits the Pug's personality, it will be placed in a home where the love and care of the Pug is a priority. We will take in any Pug whose health will allow it to live in an environment that provides an acceptable quality of life. Any Pug that is not adoptable due to health issues will be permanently placed in a loving foster home to live out their life with dignity and without pain. If it were not for your assistance we would not be able to accomplish our goals. no longer fits in. A change in lifestyle also occurs through divorce or an employment change, and results in the Pug being left without a home.

With the best of intentions, sometimes animals have to be relinquished - every animal that passes through the Brockton Blue Dog Shelter is part of the family, they are always welcomed back, if for any reason that they have not found the right home

COMMENTS: Utah Animal Adoption Center (UAAC) formerly Wasatch Humane is a non-euthanizing animal adoption center, rescuing an average of 1,000 dogs, cats and horses each year and placing them in loving homes. UAAC has been dedicated to reducing the tragedies of pet overpopulation, the euthanasia of healthy adoptable pets and animal suffering since 1983.<br><br>UAAC is vastly different from most traditional animal shelters. We pride ourselves on providing the most comfortable and homelike environment possible for the animals in our care.  Our adoption center is located on a beautiful 3.5. acre sanctuary located next to the Jordan River Parkway Trail. Our dogs enjoy indoor/outdoor kennels and three large fenced areas where they can safely socialize and play.  Our feline friends live communally in a large room where they can interact and relax on abundant cat tress and towers. During the warm months they venture out into an amazing outdoor cat enclosure to lounge in the sun and fresh air.<br><br>We are also unique in that we offer a lifetime guarantee for our adopted animals. If their person ever decides they can no longer care for the pet we placed with them, we will accept it back into our program, giving it another chance with a new family. The most important distinction is that we do not ever euthanize any healthy, adoptable pets.<br><br>The majority of our cats and dogs come from local and regional shelters that sadly have to euthanize thousands of animals annually. We partner with these shelters, rescuing pets form their euthanasia lists.  A few of our animals come directly from owners, when hardships make it impossible for them to care for their pet.<br><br>UAAC also has a horse rescue and adoption program. For years we have taken in horses from a variety of unfortunate situations.  Some are rescued from cruelty and neglect, or others are turned over to us due to economic hardships. These majestic animals are available for adoption at our beautiful new Equine Center located on ten acres of renovated property. <br><br>Education Program: Our Lesson In Kindness program offers classroom presentations on kind and responsible treatment of animals.  We give tours of our facility and offer a variety of service learning projects to students of all ages.

COMMENTS: Our sanctuary is located in Glenwood, near DeLand, FloridaDescription	JOURNEY'S END ANIMAL SANCTUARY is a private sanctuary with a capacity for over 300 dogs, cats, horses, pigs, sheep, and birds who have been abused, neglected or have special needs. Unlike traditional shelters that emphasize adoption, the primary purpose of Journey's End is to provide lifetime care and sheltering of animals who, while still able to lead a quality life, are unable to find homes due to old age, chronic illness, handicaps, temperament issues or other factors.In addition to food, shelter and medical treatment, the animals receive nurturing attention in a secure, homelike setting scaled appropriately to promote maximum human contact and quality of life for each resident animal. The bucolic setting consists of a large attractive ranch house and out buildings, surrounded by acres of mature trees, shrubs, lawn, and horse pastures. There are no cages and animals are free to move about, interacting with one another, volunteer staff members and other humans who visit the sanctuary. The perimeter of the property is fenced to provide security and protection for the animals.The mission of Journey's End also includes expanding a program to educate the public, and promoting animal sponsorship programs. School programs have been a dominant theme and will continue to be a major focus. Special emphasis is given to the responsibilities of pet ownership, spay/neuter programs, and the reporting of animal abuse.To preserve and develop Journey's End (established 1974), a board of directors was formed in August 1998 and non-profit status 501(c)(3) was granted in 1999. Initially, the sanctuary was personally funded by its founder Florence Thuot.Private donations and sponsorships provide the majority of funds. Currently, there is no local, state, or federal government funding.By example, Journey's End hopes to change the public's attitude toward euthanasia of animals who are otherwise capable of living a quality life, and to show the importance of humanely caring for all animals, including those who have been abused, neglected, or have special needs.

COMMENTS: Mid-Atlantic Basset Hound Rescue is a basset hound rescue group who provides veterinary care, food, shelter and support to basset hounds needing assistance in the mid-Atlantic states. We treat these animals with care and respect. MidABHR makes decisions based on compassion and with concern for the quality of life of each individual basset hound. We place basset hounds in our care into foster homes and permanent homes with consideration to personality, behavior, and special needs. We provide continuing support to adoptive families throughout the lifetime of the dogs.We work in direct cooperation with all local and state shelters to reduce euthanasia of basset hounds. Of the bassets we rescue and care for, approximately 60% come from these shelters. The other 40% of our bassets are surrendered by their current owners directly into MidABHR care. By taking in bassets surrendered by their owners, MidABHR helps ease the burden on our local animal shelters by preventing those bassets from ever entering the animal shelter system.

COMMENTS: About Greyhounds Rock FredericksburgEach of us knows someone who has lost a dog to cancer. Cancer is the leading cause of death for our canine companions. According to the Morris Foundation, up to 50% of all canines will die from cancer. Greyhounds ROCK Fredericksburg, a 501c(3) non-profit fund-raising charity, was created to raise awareness and funds to support canine cancer research, to honor the dogs that are or have been affected by this disease, and to offer encouragement and education to the people who love them.Greyhounds Rock Fredericksburg is working with researchers at Ohio State University to help find cures and provide help to area pet owners. Numerous local owners have benefited from Greyhound Rock's work with OSU's program to provide free chemotherapy to dogs in need, as well as our educational seminars on topics such as grief support, becoming a therapy dog team, and how to foster a homeless dog. Greyhounds Rock has also begun work with local firehouses to provide oxygen masks for cats & dogs, Red Cross first aid books and veterinary-led instruction on how to administer first aid to companion animals.Cancer research for the benefit of animals also has applications in human medical treatments. Doctors of veterinary medicine at Ohio State have even collaborated with doctors at Nationwide Children's Hospital. We find hope in the possibility that another animal (or even a human) will benefit from research that our support is helping to fund.Greyhounds Rock cannot succeed without donations or sponsors. Every donation to our events, or sponsorship from individuals, groups, and merchants, helps achieve the goal .... effective treatment, and an eventual cure, for canine cancer.

COMMENTS: Operation Paws for Homes, Inc. rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters reducing the numbers being euthanized daily. We provide foster homes where they can get the love and attention needed before finding their forever homes. Our organization provides pet adoption services in Virginia, Washington DC, Maryland, and parts of Southern Pennsylvania. Operation Paws for Homes, a 501(c)(3) organization, is 100% donor funded and could not save these dogs and fulfill their dreams of being united with their forever families, without the dedication of our incredible adopters, fosters, donors and volunteers. Sadly, without our help, all of these adoptable animals would face almost certain euthanasia - usually within days or hours of arriving at the shelter. Each year we take in hundreds of wonderful animals who were left at shelters by no fault of their own.

COMMENTS: Dugan Foundation is currently an all volunteer organization, founded on the principle that there is no reason to kill a companion animal for population control. We do, therefore, everything in our power to assist existing non-profit organizations to shelter, adopt and care for the homeless companion animals.  We also work to ensure all of our programs have an educational component to allow people to learn what it takes to make a no-kill community. The creation of a no-kill community is based on the development and implementation of a community wide comprehensive animal welfare plan.  The Dugan Foundation, in collaboration with local shelters and rescues and hundreds of passionate volunteers, has been leading the development of this comprehensive plan effort since 2003. The decrease in euthanized homeless animals reflects our effort.  With all the work that has been done, it is dwarfed by all the work that needs to be done. The plan includes: high volume no cost spay neuter services to decrease the number of animals coming into shelters; high volume adoption events to increase the number of animals leaving a shelter; intensive re-homing and retention services to keep the animals in their current homes; long term care in the form of a Sanctuary for those that are not adopted; increasing the strength and capacity of all smaller rescues and shelters through grant giving so that they can do more; and outreach in every form, to teach and train and advise on appropriate companion animals care and the responsibilities that come with the privilege.

COMMENTS: Arizona Labrador & Giant Breed Rescue was formed October 2005 in Phoenix AZ, by a group of experienced dog rescue volunteers who wanted a different kind of rescue group.  We are a federally recognized charitable 501(c)3 organization (donations are tax deductible).  We are an all volunteer, non profit organization that is dedicated to re-homingLabradors, Great Danes, Mastiffs, Great Pyrenees, Elkhounds, Newfoundlands, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Saint Bernards, Irish Wolfhounds and Deer Hounds.  Most of our volunteers have several dogs themselves.Our rescues come from several sources.  First and foremost being owner turn-ins -these are dogs whose owners can no longer care for them.  We take the dog into our organization rather than having the dog turned over to the Humane Society or Animal Care and Control.  There is great value bringing these dogs into our program.  They are less likely to be exposed to disease or suffer mental stress by moving from a home situation to a smaller program such as ours.  The transition for the dog to the new home is much easier. Owner turn-ins also allow us to have a more complete history of the dog.  We participate in the Maricopa County Animal Care & Control New Hope Program. The program allows us to intake dogs that are slated to be euthanized, often for no other reason than a lack of space.   In addition, we work with other rescue groups who may not have room for a specific dog.   Once we intake a dog it usually will spend time in a foster home.  Our foster homes are all volunteers that care for their foster dogs as if they were their own.  This includes working on housebreaking, basic training, grooming and medical care.  All dogs available for adoption have had a basic veterinary checkup, have current vaccinations and a micro chip.ALGBR is dedicated to educating the public on the breeds we rescue.  We participate in both public and private events; educate school children and the general public.  We are a non-profit* organization that is run solely on donations and all of our "employees" are unpaid volunteers.  We do this because we love these wonderful creatures and we want to place as many as we can into their forever home.

COMMENTS: AIR Dogs: Paws for Minds is a program developed by AIR Attitudes In Reverse. Our mission is to educate about good mental health and suicide prevention. Dogs are a BIG part of our advocacy work. Petting dogs release oxytocin, dopamine and seratonin, good de-stressing brain chemicals. We go to schools and talk to students and dogs come with us to help educate. Dogs come to awareness events. Recently, we started the Paws for Minds program, where we locate a dog to be rescued and placed them as an emotional support dog with a person with an emotional disability. http://youtu.be/aqlcVT-Wt0U

COMMENTS: Basset Rescue Across Texas, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization staffed solely by volunteers devoted to the rescue of unwanted, abused, and homeless Basset Hounds in the Dallas, Texas area and surrounding regions.  In conjunction with our rescue activities, educating the community regarding responsible and humane pet ownership is another aspect of our mission. This includes informing the public of the current pet overpopulation crisis, the benefits of spaying/neutering programs, and the dangers of irresponsible breeding. Finally, our group is also focused on promoting a sense of community amongst those who are "owned" by a basset hound (or would like to be.) We thought our name, BRAT, was appropriate. Anyone who's a basset slave know our little darlings are adorable, lovable brats! And we mean that in the most affectionate way!
