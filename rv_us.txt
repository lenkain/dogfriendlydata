COMMENTS: The campground at this state park offers 125 non-electric camp sites and 10 full service sites with electric, water and sewer hookups. Amenities include showers, flush toilets and a dump station. This 32 acre state park does not allow dogs on the beach and does not really have any hiking trails. Up to two dogs per campsite are allowed and they must be leashed and cleaned up after. There is a $1 per pet fee. To get there you will need to take a ferry to South Bass Island. Miller Boat Line departs from Catawba and Jet Express departs from Port Clinton. Both ferries go to the island and both allow leashed dogs. Jet Express requires that dogs stay on the outside deck. While both ferries offer passenger transportation, Miller Boat Line also offers limited vehicle service. Once on the island, you can either drive your own car or rent a dog-friendly golf cart. From the village, take Catawba Avenue until you reach the park.
