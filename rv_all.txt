COMMENTS: Les Refuges Perches, just opened June 20th of 2014, offers 10 fully furnished, heated & insulated unique tree houses with many amenities in the Laurentians and the Mont-Tremblant region. The secluded tree houses offer you nature and fresh air without foregoing the comfortable features of home. The individual tree houses are all different, made to fit into the natural environment. They all have sunny terraces, picnic tables, an outside fire pit, and are equipped for cooking. The tree houses are only accessible by foot and water, creating a secluded feel. The main parking and reception pavilion area is only a 12-20 minute walk from the tree houses, and offers showers and bathrooms, laundry facilities, wi-fi and a small convenience store (at the park gate, summertime only). Dogs are more then welcome in the tree houses, on the site, and on the many hiking trails if they are on leash. Les Refuges Perches is located in a 2000 acre protected regional park (CTEL), with many outdoor activities right on site. Some of the activities are 36km of hiking trails, 3 stocked lakes to fish on, swimming, boat rentals, and snowshoeing in the winter. For more information and to choose your preferred treehouse, visit their website.
